<h3>MANIFOLDNESS IS DISTANCE FROM UNITY, AND
EVIL.</h3>

<p>1. Does manifoldness consist in distance from
unity? Is infinity this distance carried to the extreme,
because it is an innumerable manifoldness? Is then
infinity an evil, and are we ourselves evil when we are
manifold? (That is probable); or every being becomes
manifold when, not being able to remain turned
towards itself, it blossoms out; it extends while dividing;
and thus losing all unity in its expansion, it becomes
manifoldness, because there is nothing that holds
its parts mutually united. If, nevertheless, there still
remain something that holds its parts mutually united,
then, though blossoming out, (the essence) remains,
and becomes manifoldness.</p>

<h3>HOW MANIFOLDNESS IS AN EVIL.</h3>

<p>But what is there to be feared in magnitude? If
(the essence) that has increased could feel (it would
feel that which in itself has become evil; for) it would
feel that it had issued from itself, and had even gone
to a great distance (from itself). No (essence), indeed,
seeks that which is other than itself; every
(essence) seeks itself. The movement by which (an
essence) issues from itself is caused either by "audacity,"
or necessity. Every (being) exists in the highest
degree not when it becomes manifold or great, but
when it belongs to itself; now this occurs when it concentrates
upon itself. That which desires to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">644</a></span>
great in some other manner is ignorant of that in which
true greatness consists; instead of proceeding towards
its legitimate goal, it turns towards the outside. Now,
on the contrary, to turn towards oneself, is to remain
in oneself. The demonstration of this may be seen in
that which participates in greatness; if (the being)
develop itself so that each of its parts exist apart, each
part will indeed exist, but (the being) will no longer
be what it originally was. To remain what it is, all
its parts must converge towards unity; so that, to be
what it was in its being, it should not be large, but
single. When it possesses magnitude, and quantity
inheres in it, it is destroyed, while when it possesses
unity, it possesses itself. Doubtless the universe is
both great and beautiful; but it is beautiful only so far
as the unity holds it in from dissipating into infinity.
Besides, if it be beautiful, it is not because it is great,
but because it participates in beauty; now, if it need
participation in beauty, it is only because it has become
so large. Indeed, isolated from beauty, and considered
in itself as great, it is ugly. From this point of view,
what is great is with beauty in the relation obtaining
between matter and form, because what needs adornment
is manifold; consequently, what is great has so
much more need of being adorned and is so much more
ugly (as it is great).</p>

<h3>WHAT IS THE NUMBER OF THE INFINITE.</h3>

<p>2. What opinion should we hold of that which is
called the number of infinity? We must begin by
examining how it can be a number, if it be infinite.
Indeed, sense-objects are not infinite; consequently,
the number which inheres in them could not be infinite,
and he who numbers them, does not number infinity.
Even if they were multiplied by two, or by more, they
still could always be determined; if they were multiplied
in respect of the past or the future, they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">645</a></span>
still be determined. It might be objected that number
is not infinite in an absolute manner, but only (in a
relative manner) in this sense, that it is always possible
to add thereto. But he who numbers does not
create numbers; they were already determined, and
they existed (before being conceived by him who was
numbering them). As beings in the intelligible world
are determined, their number is also determined by
the quantity of beings. Just as we make man manifold
by adding to him the beautiful, and other things of
the kind, we can make an image of number correspond
to the image of every intelligible being. Just as, in
thought, we can multiply a town that does not exist,
so can we multiply numbers. When we number the
parts of time, we limit ourselves to applying to them
the numbers that we have in ourselves, and which,
merely on that account, do not cease remaining in us.</p>

<h3>HOW THE INFINITE REACHED EXISTENCE.</h3>

<p>3. How did the infinite, in spite of its infiniteness,
reach existence? For the things which have arrived
at existence, and which subsist, have been preparatorily
contained in a number. Before answering this
question, we must examine whether, when it forms
part of veritable essences, multitude can be evil. On
high, the manifoldness remains united, and is hindered
from completely being manifoldness, because it is the
one essence; but this is inferior to unity by this very
condition that it is manifoldness, and thus, is imperfect
in respect to unity. Therefore, though not
having the same nature as the One, but a nature somewhat
degraded (in comparison with unity), manifoldness
is inferior to unity; but, by the effect of the unity
which it derives from the One (since it is the one
essence), it still possesses a venerable character, reduces
to unity the manifold it contains, and makes it
subsist in an immutable manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">646</a></span></p>

<h3>HOW INFINITY CAN SUBSIST IN THE INTELLIGIBLE
WORLD.</h3>

<p>How can infinity subsist in the intelligible world?
Either it exists among the genuine essences, and then
is determined; or it is not determined, and then it
does not exist among the veritable essences, but it
must be classified among the things which exist in
perpetual becoming, such as <span class="locked">time.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> The infinite is
determinate, but it is not any the less infinite; for it is
not the <span class="locked">limit<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> which receives the determination, but
the <span class="locked">infinite<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span>; and between the boundary and the infinite
there is no intermediary that could receive the
determination. This infinite acts as if it were the idea
of the boundary, but it is contained by what embraces
it exteriorly. When I say that it flees, I do not mean
that it passes from one locality to another, for it has
no locality; but I mean that space has existed from the
very moment that this infinite was <span class="locked">embraced.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> We
must not imagine that what is called the movement of
the infinite consists in a displacement, nor admit
that the infinite by itself possesses any other of the
things that could be named; thus the infinite could
neither move, nor remain still. Where indeed would
it halt, since the place indicated by the word "where"
is posterior to infinity? Movement is attributed to
infinity only to explain that the infinite has no permanency.
Should we believe that the infinite exists on
high in one only and single place, or that it arises
there, and descends here below? No: for it is in respect
to one only and single place that we are enabled
to conceive both what has risen and does not descend,
as well as that which <span class="locked">descends.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span></p>

<h3>INFINITE IS CONCEIVED BY THE THOUGHT'S
MAKING ABSTRACTION OF THE FORM.</h3>

<p>How then can we conceive the infinite? By making
abstraction of form by thought. How will it be conceived?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">647</a></span>
We may conceive of the infinite as simultaneously
being the contraries, and not being them.
It will have to be conceived as being simultaneously
great and small; for the infinite becomes both of
<span class="locked">these.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> It may also be conceived as both being moved,
and being <span class="locked">stable<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span>; for the infinite becomes these two
things also. But before the infinite becomes these two
contraries, it is neither of them in any determinate
manner; otherwise, you would have determined it. By
virtue of its nature, the infinite is these things therefore
in an indeterminate and infinite manner; only on this
condition will it appear to be these contrary things.
If, by applying your thought to the infinite, you do
not entice it into a determination, as into a net, you
will see the infinite escaping you, and you will not
find anything in it that would be a unity; otherwise,
you would have determined it. If you represented to
yourself the infinite as a unity, it would seem to you
manifold; if you say that it is manifold, it will again
make game of you; for, all things do not form a
manifold where no one thing is one. From still another
standpoint, the nature of the infinite is movement, and
according to another nature, stability; for its property
of being invisible by itself constitutes a movement
which distinguishes it from <span class="locked">intelligence<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span>; its property
of not being able to escape, of being exteriorly embraced,
of being circumscribed within an unescapable
circle constitutes a sort of stability. Movement therefore
cannot be predicated of infinity, without also attributing
stability to it.</p>

<h3>HOW OTHER NUMBERS FORM PART OF THE
INTELLIGIBLE WORLD.</h3>

<p>4. Let us now examine how the numbers form
part of the intelligible world. Are they inherent in
the other forms? Or are they, since all eternity, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">648</a></span>
consequences of the existence of these forms? In the
latter case, as the very essence possessed primary existence,
we would first conceive the monad; then, as
movement and stability emanated from it, we would
have the triad; and each one of the remaining intelligible
entities would lead to the conception of some
of the other numbers. If it were not so, if a unity
were inherent in each intelligible entity, the unity inherent
in the first Essence would be the monad; the
unity inherent in what followed it, if there be an order
in the intelligible entities, would be the "pair"; last,
the unity inhering in some other intelligible entity,
such as, for instance, in ten, would be the decad.
Nevertheless this could not yet be so, each number
being conceived as existing in itself. In this case, will
we be compelled to admit that number is anterior to
the other intelligible entities, or posterior thereto?
On this subject <span class="locked">Plato<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> says that men have arrived to
the notion of number by the succession of days and
nights, and he thus refers the conception of number
to the diversity of (objective) things. He therefore
seems to teach that it is first the numbered objects that
by their diversity produce numbers, that number results
from movement of the soul, which passes from
one object to another, and that it is thus begotten
when the soul enumerates; that is, when she says to
herself, Here is one object, and there is another; while,
so long as she thinks of one and the same object, she
affirms nothing but unity. But when Plato says that
being is in the veritable number, and that the number
is in the <span class="locked">being,<a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> he intends to teach that by itself
number possesses a hypostatic substantial existence,
that it is not begotten in the soul which enumerates,
but that the variety of sense-objects merely recalls to
the soul the notion of number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">649</a></span></p>

<h3>PYTHAGOREAN INTELLIGIBLE NUMBERS DISCUSSED.</h3>

<p>5. What then is the nature of number? Is it a
consequence, and partially an aspect of each being,
like man and one-man, essence and one-essence? Can
the same be said for all the intelligibles, and is that the
origin of all numbers? If so, how is it that on high
(in the intelligible world) the pair and triad exist?
How are all things considered within unity, and how
will it be possible to reduce number to unity, since
it has a similar nature? There would thus be a multitude
of unities, but no other number would be reduced
to unity, except the absolute One. It might be objected
that a pair is the thing, or rather the aspect of
the thing which possesses two powers joined together,
such as is a composite reduced to unity, or such as
the Pythagoreans conceived the <span class="locked">numbers,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> which they
seem to have predicated of other objects, by analogy.
For instance, they referred to justice as the (Tetrad,
or) <span class="locked">group-of-four,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> and likewise for everything else.
Thus a number, as for instance a group-of-ten, would
be considered as a single (group of) unity, and would
be connected with the manifold contained in the single
object. This, however, is an inadequate account of
our conception of "ten"; we speak of the objects
after gathering (ten) separate objects. Later, indeed,
if these ten objects constitute a new unity, we call
the group a "decad." The same state of affairs must
obtain with intelligible Numbers. If such were the
state of affairs (answers Plotinos), if number were considered
only within objects, would it possess hypostatic
existence? It might be objected, What then would
hinder that, though we consider white within things,
that nevertheless the White should (besides) have a
hypostatic substantial existence? For movement is
indeed considered within essence, and yet (it is agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">650</a></span>
that) movement possesses a "hypostatic" substantial
existence within essence. The case of number, however,
is not similar to that of movement; for we have
demonstrated that movement thus considered in itself
is something <span class="locked">unitary.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> Moreover, if no more than
such a hypostatic substantial existence be predicated of
number, it ceases to be a being, and becomes an accident,
though it would not even then be a pure accident;
for what is an accident must be something
before becoming the accident (of some substance).
Though being inseparable therefrom, it must possess
its own individual nature in itself, like whiteness; and
before being predicated of something else, it already is
what it is posited. Consequently, if one be in every
(being), one man is not identical with man; if "one"
be something different from <span class="locked">"man"<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> and from every
other (being), if it be something common to all
(beings), one must be anterior to all men and to all
other (beings), so that man and all other beings may
be one. The one is therefore anterior to movement,
since movement is one, and likewise anterior to essence,
to allow for essence also being one. This of
course does not refer to the absolute Unity that is
recognized as superior to essence, but of the unity
which is predicated of every intelligible form. Likewise,
above that of which the decad is predicated subsists
the "Decad in itself," for that in which the decad
is recognized could not be the Decad in itself.</p>

<h3>THE INTELLIGIBLE UNITY AND DECAD EXIST
BEFORE ALL NUMBERS ONE OR TEN.</h3>

<p>Does unity therefore inhere in essences, and does it
subsist with them? If it inhere in essences, or if it be
an accident, as health is an accident of man, it must be
something individual (like health). If unity be an
element of the composite, it will first have to exist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">651</a></span>
(individually), and be an unity in itself, so as to
be able to unify itself to something else; then,
being blended with this other thing that it has
unified, it will not longer remain really one, and will
thereby even become double. Besides, how would
that apply to the decad? What need of the (intelligible)
Decad has that which is already a decad, by
virtue of the power it possesses? Will it receive its
form from that Decad? If it be its matter, if it be
ten and decad only because of the presence of the
Decad, the Decad will have first to exist in itself,
in the pure and simple state of (being a) Decad.</p>

<h3>WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THESE INTELLIGIBLE
NUMBERS?</h3>

<p>6. But if, independently of the things themselves,
there be an One in itself, and a Decad in itself; and
if the intelligible entities be unities, pairs, or triads, independently
of what they are by their being, what then
is the nature of these Numbers? What is their constitution?
It must be admitted that a certain Reason
presides over the generation of these Numbers. It is
therefore necessary clearly to understand that in
general, if intelligible forms at all exist, it is not because
the thinking principle first thought each of them,
and thereby gave them hypostatic existence. Justice,
for instance, was not born because the thinking principle
thought what justice was; nor movement, because
it thought what movement was. Thus thought
had to be posterior to the thing thought, and the
thought of justice to justice itself. On the other hand,
thought is anterior to the thing that owes its existence
to thought, since this thing exists only because it is
thought. If then justice were identical with such a
thought, it would be absurd that justice should be
nothing else than its definition; for in this case, the
thinking of justice or movement, would amount to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">652</a></span>
conception of these objects (by a definition). Now
this would be tantamount to conceiving the definition
of a thing that did not exist, which is impossible.</p>

<h3>JUSTICE, LIKE AN INTELLECTUAL STATUE, WAS
BORN OF ITSELF.</h3>

<p>The statement that in what is immaterial, knowledge
and the known thing <span class="locked">coincide,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> must not be understood
to mean that it is the knowledge of the thing
which is the thing itself, nor that the reason which
contemplates an object is this object itself, but rather,
conversely, that it is the thing which, existing without
matter, is purely intelligible and intellection. I do not
here mean the intellection which is neither a definition
nor an intuition of a thing; but I say that the thing
itself, such as it exists in the intelligible world, is exclusively
intelligence and knowledge. It is not (the
kind of) knowledge that applies itself to the intelligible,
it is the (actual) thing itself which keeps that knowledge
(thereof possessed by reason) from remaining
different from it, just as the knowledge of a material
object remains different from that object; but it
is a veritable (kind of) knowledge, that is, a
knowledge which is not merely a simple image
of the known thing, but really is the thing itself.
It is not therefore the thought of the movement
which produced movement in itself, but the movement
in itself which produced the thought, so that
the thought thinks itself as movement, and as thought.
On the one hand, intelligible movement is thought by
the intelligible Essence; on the other hand, it is movement
in itself because it is first&mdash;for there is no movement
anterior thereto; it is real movement, because it
is not the accident of a subject, but because it is the
actualization of the essence which moves, and possesses
actualized (existence); it is therefore "being,"
though it be conceived as different from essence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">653</a></span>
Justice, for instance, is not the simple thought of justice;
it is a certain disposition of Intelligence, or rather
it is an actualization of a determinate nature. The
face of Justice is more beautiful than the evening or
morning stars, and than all visible <span class="locked">beauty.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> Justice
may be imagined as an intellectual statue which has
issued from itself and which has manifested itself such
as it is in itself; or rather, which subsists essentially in
itself.</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE THINKS THINGS NOT BECAUSE THEY
EXIST, BUT BECAUSE IT POSSESSES THEM.</h3>

<p>7. We must, in fact, conceive intelligible essences
as subsisting in one nature, and one single nature as
possessing and embracing all (things). There no one
thing is separated from the others, as in the sense-world,
where the sun, moon, and other objects each
occupy a different locality; but all things exist together
in one unity; such is the nature of intelligence. The
(universal) Soul imitates it, in this respect, as does
also the power called Nature, conformably to which,
and by virtue of which individuals are begotten each
in a different place, while she remains in herself. But,
although all things exist together (in the unity of
Intelligence), each of them is none the less different
from the others. Now, these things which subsist in
Intelligence and "being," are seen by the Intelligence
that possesses them, not because it observes them, but
because it possesses them without feeling the need of
distinguishing them from each other; because from all
eternity they have dwelt within it distinct from each
other. We believe in the existence of these things
on the faith of those who admire them, because
they have participated therein. As to the magnitude
and beauty of the intelligible world, we can judge of it
by the love which the Soul feels for it, and if other
things feel love for the Soul, it is because she herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">654</a></span>
possesses an intellectual nature, and that by her the
other things can, to some extent, become assimilated
to Intelligence. How indeed could we admit that here
below was some organism gifted with beauty, without
recognizing that the Organism itself (the intelligible
<span class="locked">world<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span>) possesses an admirable and really unspeakable
beauty? Further, the perfect Organism is composed
of all the organisms; or rather it embraces all
the organisms; just as our Universe is one, yet simultaneously
is visible, because it contains all the things
which are in the visible universe.</p>

<h3>WHAT AND HOW IS EVERY INTELLIGIBLE ENTITY.</h3>

<p>8. Since then the (universal) Organism possesses
primary existence, since it is simultaneously organism,
intelligence, and veritable "Being"; and as we state
that it contains all organisms, numbers, justice, beauty,
and the other similar beings&mdash;for we mean something
different by the Man himself, and Number itself, and
Justice itself&mdash;we have to determine, so far as it is
possible in such things, what is the condition and nature
of each intelligible entity.</p>

<h3>NUMBER MUST EXIST IN THE PRIMARY ESSENCE.</h3>

<p>(To solve this problem) let us begin by setting aside
sensation, and let us contemplate Intelligence by our
intelligence exclusively. Above all, let us clearly
understand that, as in us life and intelligence do not
consist of a corporeal mass, but in a power without
mass, likewise veritable "Being" is deprived of all
corporeal extension, and constitutes a power founded
on itself. It does not indeed consist in something
without force, but in a power sovereignly vital and intellectual,
which possesses life in the highest degree,
intelligence, and being. Consequently, whatever
touches this power participates in the same characteristics
according to the manner of its touch; in a higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">655</a></span>
degree, if the touch be close; in a lower degree, if the
touch be distant. If existence be desirable, the completest
existence (or, essence) is more desirable still.
Likewise, if intelligence deserve to be desired, perfect
Intelligence deserves to be desired above everything;
and the same state of affairs prevails in respect to life.
If then we must grant that the Essence is the first, and
if we must assign the first rank to Essence, the second
to Intelligence, and the third to the <span class="locked">Organism,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> as
the latter seems already to contain all things, and
Intelligence justly occupies the second rank, because it
is the actualization of "Being"&mdash;then number could
not enter into the Organism, for before the organism
already existed one and two ("Being" and Intelligence).
Nor could number exist in Intelligence, for
before Intelligence was "Being," which is both one and
manifold. (Number therefore must exist, or originate,
in the primary Being.)</p>

<h3>NUMBER FOLLOWS AND PROCEEDS FROM ESSENCE.</h3>

<p>9. It remains for us to discover whether it were
"Being," in the process of division, that begat number,
or whether it be the number that divided "Being."
(This is the alternative:) either "being," movement,
stability, difference and identity produced number, or
it is number that produced all these (categories, or)
genera. Our discussion must start thus. Is it possible
that number should exist in itself, or must we contemplate
two in two objects, three in three objects, and
so forth? The same question arises about unity as
considered within numbers; for if number can exist in
itself independently of numbered <span class="locked">things,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> it can also
exist previously to the essences. Can number therefore
exist before the essences? It might be well preliminarily
to assert that number is posterior to the
Essence, and proceeds therefrom. But then if essence
be one essence, and if two essences be two essences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">656</a></span>
one will precede essence, and the other numbers
will precede the essences. (Would number then
precede the essences) only in thought and conception,
or also in the hypostatic existence? We
should think as follows. When you think of a
man as being one, or the beautiful as being one,
the one that is thus conceived in both (beings)
is something that is thought only afterward. Likewise,
when you simultaneously consider a dog and a horse,
here also two is evidently something posterior. But
if you beget the man, if you beget the horse or the
dog, or if you produce them outside when they already
exist in you, without begetting them, nor producing
them by mere chance (of seeing them), you will say,
"We should go towards one (being), then pass to
another, and thus get two; then make one more being,
by adding my person." Likewise, (beings) were not
numbered after they were created, but before they
were created, when (the creator) decided how many
should be created.</p>

<h3>NUMBER SPLIT THE UNITY INTO PLURALITY;
PYTHAGOREAN IDENTIFICATION OF IDEAS
AND NUMBERS.</h3>

<p>The universal Number therefore existed before the
essences (were created); consequently, Number was
not the essences. Doubtless, Number was in Essence;
but it was not yet the number of Essence; for Essence
still was one. But the power of Number, hypostatically
existing within it, divided it, and made it beget
the manifold. Number is either the being or actualization
(of Essence); the very Organism and Intelligence
are number. Essence is therefore the unified number,
while the essences are developed number; Intelligence
is the number which moves itself, and the Organism
is the number that contains. Since therefore Essence
was born from Unity, Essence, as it existed within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">657</a></span>
Unity, must be Number. That is why (the <span class="locked">Pythagoreans<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span>)
called the ideas unities and numbers.</p>

<h3>TWO KINDS OF NUMBER: ESSENTIAL AND UNITARY.</h3>

<p>Such then is "essential" Number (number that is
"Being"). The other kind of number, which is called
a number composed of digits, or "unities," is only an
image of the former. The essential Number is contemplated
in the intelligible forms, and assists in producing
them; on the other hand, it exists primitively in
essence, with essence, and before the essences. The
latter find therein their foundation, source, root and
<span class="locked">principle.<a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> Indeed, Number is the principle of Essence,
and rests in it, otherwise it would split up. On
the contrary, the One does not rest upon essence;
otherwise essence would be one before participating
in the One; likewise, what participates in the decad
would be the decad already before participating in the
decad.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE IS A LOCATION FOR THE THINGS YET
TO BE PRODUCED.</h3>

<p>10. Subsisting therefore in the manifold, Essence
therefore became Number when it was aroused to
multiplicity, because it already contained within itself
a sort of preformation or representation of the essences
which it was ready to produce, offering the
essences, as it were, a locality for the things whose
foundation they were to be. When we say, "so much
gold," or, "so many other objects," gold is one, and
one does not thereby intend to make gold out of the
number, but to make a number out of the gold; it is
because one already possesses the number that one
seeks to apply it to gold, so as to determine its quality.
If essences were anterior to Number, and if Number
were contemplated in them when the enumerating
power enumerates the objects, the number of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">658</a></span>
(beings), whatever it is, would be accidental, instead
of being determined in advance. If this be not the
case, then must number, preceding (the beings) determine
how many of them must exist; which means
that, by the mere fact of the primitive existence of the
Number, the (beings) which are produced undergo the
condition of being so many, and each of them participates
in unity whenever they are one. Now every
essence comes from Essence because essence, by itself,
is Essence; likewise, the One is one by itself. If every
(being) be one, and if the multitude of (beings) taken
together form the unity that is in them, they are one
as the triad is one, and all beings also are one; not
as is the Monad (or Unity), but as is a thousand, or
any other number. He who, while enumerating, produced
things, proclaims that there are a thousand of
them, claims to do no more than to tell out what he
learns from the things, as if he was indicating their
colors, while really he is only expressing a condition
of his reason; without which, he would not know how
much of a multitude was present there. Why then
does he speak so? Because he knows how to enumerate;
which indeed he knows if he know the number,
and this he can know only if the number exist.
But not to know what is the number, at least under
the respect of quantity, would be ridiculous, and even
impossible.</p>

<h3>AN OBJECT'S EXISTENCE IMPLIES A PREVIOUS
MODEL IN ITSELF.</h3>

<p>When one speaks of good things, one either designates
objects which are such by themselves, or asserts
that the good is their attribute. If one designate the
goods of the first <span class="locked">order,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> one is speaking of the first
Hypostasis, or rank of existence; if one designate the
things of which the good is the attribute, this implies
the existence of a nature of the good which has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">659</a></span>
attributed to them, or which produces this characteristic
within them, or which is the Good in itself, or which,
producing the good, nevertheless dwells in its own
nature. Likewise, when, in connection with (beings),
we speak of a decad, (or, group of ten), one is either
referring to the Decad in itself, or, referring to the
things of which the decad is an attribute, one is forced
to recognize the existence of a Decad in itself, whose
being is that of a decad. Consequently, the conferring
of the name "decad" implies either that these (beings)
are the Decad in itself, or above them in another Decad
whose being is that of being a Decad in itself.</p>

<h3>UNITY AND NUMBER PRECEDE THE ONE AND THE
MANY BEINGS.</h3>

<p>In general, everything which is predicated of an
object either comes to it from without, or is its actualization.
Unless by nature it be inconstant, being present
now, and absent then, if it be always present, it is
a being when the object is a being. If it be denied
that its nature were that of a being, it will surely be
granted that it is a part of the essences, and that it is
an essence. Now, if the object can be conceived without
the thing which is its actualization, this thing nevertheless
exists contemporaneously with it, even though
in thought it be conceived posteriorily. If the object
cannot be conceived without this thing, as man cannot
be conceived of without one, in this case one is not
posterior to man, but is simultaneous, or even anterior,
since the man's subsistence is entirely dependent
thereon. As to us, we recognize that Unity and Number
precede (Essence and the essences).</p>

<h3>UNITY MUST EXIST IN THE INTELLIGIBLE BEFORE
BEING APPLIED TO MULTIPLE BEINGS.</h3>

<p>11. It may be objected that the decad is nothing
else than ten unities. If the existence of the One be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">660</a></span>
granted, why should we not also grant the existence
of ten unities? Since the supreme Unity (the unity
of the first Essence), possesses hypostatic existence,
why should the case not be the same with the other
unities (the complex unities contained within each of
the essences)? It must not be supposed that the
supreme Unity is bound up with a single essence; for
in this case each of the other (beings) would no longer
be one. If each of the other (beings) must be one,
then unity is common to all the (beings); that is that
single nature which may be predicated of the multiple
(beings), and which must, as we have explained it,
subsist in itself (in the primary essence) before the
unity which resides in the multiple (beings).</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME UNITY ADJUSTS ALL LOWER GROUP
UNITIES.</h3>

<p>As unity is seen in some one (being), and then in
some other, if the second unity possess hypostatic
existence also, then the supreme Unity (of the first
Essence) will not alone possess hypostatic existence,
and there will be thus a multitude of unities (as there
is a multitude of beings). If the hypostatic existence
of the first Unity be alone acknowledged, this will exist
either in the Essence in itself, or in the One in itself.
If it exist in the Essence in itself, the other unities
(which exist in the other beings) will then be such
merely by figure of speech, and will no longer be
subordinated to the primary unity; or number will be
composed of dissimilar unities, and the unities will
differ from each other in so far as they are unities.
If the primary unity exist already in the Unity in itself,
what need would that Unity in itself have of that unity
to be one? If all that be impossible, we shall have to
recognize the existence of the One which is purely and
simply one, which, by its "being" is entirely independent
of all the other beings, which is named the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">661</a></span>
Unity, and is conceived of as such. If unity exist on
high (in the intelligible world) without any object that
may be called one, why might not another One (the
one of the first Being) subsist on high also? Why
would not all the (beings), each being a separate
unity, not constitute a multitude of unities, which might
be the "multiple unity"? As the nature (of the first
Being) begets, or rather, as it has begotten (from all
eternity); or at least, as it has not limited itself to one
of the things it has begotten, thus rendering the unity
(of the first Being) somewhat continuous; if it circumscribe
(what it produces) and promptly ceases in
its procession, it begets small numbers; if it advance
further, moving alone not in foreign matters, but in
itself, it begets large numbers. It thus harmonizes
every plurality and every being with every number,
knowing well that, if each of the (beings) were not in
harmony with some number, either they would not
exist, or they would bear neither proportion, measure,
nor reason.</p>

<h3>ONE AND UNITY ARE WITHIN US; INDEPENDENTLY
OF THE ONE OUTSIDE.</h3>

<p>12. (Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>) objects that "One" and "Unity"
have no hypostatic (or, genuine) existence. Everywhere
the One is something that is one. That is
nothing but a simple modification experienced in our
soul in presence of each essence. We might as easily
affirm that when we assert "essence," this is but a
simple modification of our soul, Essence (in itself)
being absolutely nothing. If it be insisted that Essence
exists because it excites and strikes our soul, which
then represents it to herself, we see that the soul is
equally impressed by the One, and represents Him to
herself. Besides, we should ask (Aristotle) if this
modification or conception of our soul do not bear
to us the aspect of unity or the manifold? So much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">662</a></span>
the more, we often say that an object is not one; evidently
we then are not deriving the notion of unity
from the object, because we are affirming that there
is no unity in it. Unity therefore dwells within us, and
it is in us without the object of which we predicate
that it is some one thing.</p>

<h3>THERE IS INDEED A UNITARY MODE OF EXISTENCE
IN OUTSIDE OBJECTS.</h3>

<p>It may be objected that having this unity in our
soul depends on receiving from the exterior object a
notion and an image, which is a conception furnished
by this object. As the philosophers who profess this
opinion do not differentiate the species of one and of
number, and as they allow them no other hypostatic
existence (than to be conceived by our soul), if they
(practically do) allow them any sort of hypostatic
existence, it will be very interesting to scrutinize the
opinions of <span class="locked">these.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span> They then say that the notion
or conception that we have of the one or of the number
derives from the objects themselves, is a notion
as much "a posteriori" as those of <span class="locked">"that,"<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span> "something,"
"crowd," "festival," "army," or of "multitude";
for, just as the manifold is nothing without the
multiple objects, nor a festival without the men
gathered to celebrate the religious ceremony, thus "the
One" is nothing without the one object, when we posit
the one, conceiving it alone, having made an abstraction
of everything else. The partisans of this opinion
will cite many examples of the same kind, as the
"right hand side," "the upper part," and their contraries.
What reality indeed (to speak as they do),
can the "right hand side" possess outside of a person
who stands or sits here or <span class="locked">there<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span>? The case is similar
with "the upper side," which refers to a certain part
of the universe, and the "lower side" to <span class="locked">another.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span>
Our first answer to this argument is that we will allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">663</a></span>
that there is a certain kind of existence in the things
themselves of which we have just spoken; but that this
mode of existence is not identical in all things, considered
either in respect to each other, or each in respect
to the One which is in all. Further, we intend
to refute one by one these arguments that have been
opposed to us.</p>

<h3>THE NOTION OF THE SUBJECT ONE DOES NOT
COME FROM THE SUBJECT ITSELF.</h3>

<p>13. To begin with, it is unreasonable to insist that
the notion of the subject one comes to us from the
subject itself (which is one), from the visible man,
for instance, or from some other animal, or even some
stone. Evidently the visible man and the One are
things entirely different, which could not be <span class="locked">identified<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span>;
otherwise, our judgment would not be able
(as it is) to predicate unity of the non-man. Besides,
as the judgment does not operate on emptiness for the
right side, and other such things, seeing a difference of
position when it tells us that an object is here, or
there; likewise, it also sees something when it says that
an object is one; for it does not experience there an
affection that is vain, and it does not affirm unity without
some foundation. It cannot be believed that the
judgment says that an object is one because it sees that
it is alone, and that there is no other; for, while saying
that there is no other, the judgment implicitly asserts
that the other is one. Further, the notions of "other"
and "different" are notions posterior to that of unity;
if the judgment did not rise to unity, it would not
assert either the "other" nor the "different"; when it
affirms that an object is alone, it says, "there is one
only object"; and therefore predicates unity before
"only." Besides, the judgment which affirms is itself
a substantial (being) before affirming unity of some
other (being); and the (being) of which it speaks is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">664</a></span>
one likewise before the judgment either asserts or conceives
anything about it. Thus (being) must be one
or many; if it be many, the one is necessarily anterior,
since, when the judgment asserts that plurality is present,
it evidently asserts that there is more than one;
likewise, when it says that an army is a multitude, it
conceives of the soldiers as arranged in one single
corps. By this last example, it is plain that the judgment
(in saying one body), does not let the multitude
remain multitude, and that it thus reveals the existence
of unity; for, whether by giving to the multitude
a unity which it does not possess, or by rapidly revealing
unity in the arrangement (which makes the body
of the multitude), the judgment reduces multitude to
unity. It does not err here about unity, any more than
when it says of a building formed by a multitude of
stones that it is a unity; for, besides, a building is more
unified than an <span class="locked">army.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> If, further, unity inhere in a
still higher degree in that which is continuous, and in a
degree still higher in what is not <span class="locked">divisible,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span> evidently
that occurs only because the unity has a real nature,
and possesses existence; for there is no greater or less
in that which does not exist.</p>

<h3>UNITY, THOUGH BY PARTICIPATION EXISTING IN
SENSE-OBJECTS, IS INTELLIGIBLE.</h3>

<p>Just as we predicate being of every sense-thing, as
well as of every intelligible thing, we predicate it in a
higher degree of intelligible things, attributing a higher
degree (of substantiality) to the (beings that are
veritable than to sense-objects), and to sense-objects
than to other genera (of physical objects); likewise,
clearly seeing unity in sense-objects in a degree higher
than in the intelligible (essences), we recognize the
existence of unity in all its modes, and we refer them
all to Unity in itself. Besides, just as "being and <span class="locked">essence"<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span>
are nothing sensual, though sense-objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">665</a></span>
participate therein, so unity, though by participation
it inhere in sense-objects, is not any the less an intelligible
Unity. Judgment grasps it by an intellectual
conception; by seeing one thing (which is sensual) it
also conceives another which it does not see (because
it is intelligible); it therefore knew this thing in advance;
and if judgment knew it in advance, judgment
was this thing, and was identical with that whose existence
it asserted. When it says, "a certain" object, it
asserts the unity, as, when it speaks of "certain" objects,
it says that they are two or more. If then one
cannot conceive of any object whatever without
"one," "two," or some other number, it becomes
possible to insist that the thing without which nothing
can be asserted or conceived, does not at all exist.
We cannot indeed deny existence to the thing without
whose existence we could not assert or conceive anything.
Now that which is everywhere necessary to
speak and to conceive must be anterior to speech and
conception, so as to contribute to their production.
If, besides, this thing be necessary to the hypostatic
existence of every essence&mdash;for there is no essence
that lacks unity&mdash;it must be anterior to being, and
being must be begotten by it. That is why we say "an
essence" instead of first positing "essence," and "a"
only thereafter, for there must be "one" in essence, to
make "several" possible; but (the converse is not
true; for) unity does not contain essence, unless unity
itself produce it by applying itself to the begetting of
it. Likewise, the word "that" (when employed to
designate an object) is not meaningless; for instead
of naming the object, it proclaims its existence, its
presence, its "being," or some other of its kinds of
"essence." The word "that" does not therefore express
something without reality, it does not proclaim
an empty conception, but it designates an object as
definitely as some proper name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">666</a></span></p>

<h3>UNITY ONLY AN ACCIDENT IN SENSE-THINGS, BUT
SOMETHING IN ITSELF IN THE INTELLIGIBLE.</h3>

<p>14. As to those who consider unity as relative,
they might be told that unity could not lose its proper
nature merely as a result of the affection experienced
by some other being without itself being affected. It
cannot cease being one without experiencing the
privation of unity by division into two or three. If,
on being divided, a mass become double without being
destroyed in respect to its being a mass, evidently,
besides the subject, there existed unity; and the mass
lost it because the unity was destroyed by the division.
So this same thing which now is present, and now
disappears, should be classified among essences
wherever it be found; and we must recognize that,
though it may be an accident of other objects, it
nevertheless exists by itself, whether it manifest in
sense-objects, or whether it be present in intelligent entities;
it is only an accident in posterior (beings,
namely, the sense-objects); but it exists in itself in the
intelligible entities, especially in the first Essence,
which is One primarily, and only secondarily essence.</p>

<h3>TWO IS NOT AN ADDITION TO ONE, BUT A CHANGE
(REFUTATION OF ARISTOTLE).</h3>

<p>The objection that unity, without itself experiencing
anything, by the mere addition of something else, is no
longer one, but becomes double, is a <span class="locked">mistake.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> The
one has not become two, and is not that which has
been added to it, nor that to which something has been
added. Each of them remains one, such as it was; but
two can be asserted of their totality, and one of each
of them separately. Two therefore, not any more than
"pair," is by nature a relation. If the pair consisted
in the union (of two objects), and if "being united"
were identical with "to duplicate," in this case the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">667</a></span>
union, as well as the pair, would constitute two. Now a
"pair" appears likewise in a state contrary (to that of
the reunion of two objects); for two may be produced
by the division of a single object. Two, therefore, is
neither reunion nor division, as it would have to be
in order to constitute a relation.</p>

<h3>OBJECTS PARTICIPATE IN NUMBERS JUST AS THEY
PARTICIPATE IN ALL INTELLIGIBLE ENTITIES.</h3>

<p>What then is the principal cause (by virtue of which
objects participate in numbers)? A being is one by
the presence of one; double, because of the presence
of the pair; just as it is white because of the presence
of whiteness; beautiful, because of the presence of
beauty; and just by that of justice. If that be not admitted,
we shall be reduced to asserting that whiteness,
beauty and justice are nothing real, and that their only
causes are simple relations; that justice consists in some
particular relation with some particular being; that
beauty has no foundation other than the affection that
we feel; that the object which seems beautiful possesses
nothing capable of exciting this affection either
by nature, or by acquirement. When you see an
object that is one, and that you call single, it is simultaneously
great, beautiful, and susceptible of receiving
a number of other qualifications. Now why should
unity not inhere in the object as well as greatness and
magnitude, sweetness and bitterness, and other qualities?
We have no right to admit that quality, whatever
it be, forms part of the number of beings, whilst quantity
is excluded; nor to limit quantity to continuous
quantity, while discrete quantity is excluded from the
conception of quantity; and that so much the less as
continuous quantity is measured by discrete quantity.
Thus, just as an object is great because of the presence
of magnitude, as it is one by the presence of unity; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">668</a></span>
is it double because of the presence of being a pair, and
so <span class="locked">forth.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span></p>

<h3>THE VERITABLE NUMBERS ARE INTELLIGIBLE
ENTITIES.</h3>

<p>Should we be asked to describe the operation of the
participation of objects in unity and in numbers, we
shall answer that this question connects with the more
general problem of the participation of objects in intelligible
forms. Besides, we shall have to admit that
the decad presents itself under different aspects, according
as it is considered to exist either in discrete
quantities, or in continuous quantities, or in the reduction
of many great forces to unity, or, last, into the intelligible
entities to which we are later raised. It is
among them, indeed, that are found the veritable
Numbers (spoken of by <span class="locked">Plato,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span>) which, instead of
being considered as discovered in other (beings), exist
within themselves; such is the Decad-in-itself, which
exists by itself, instead of simply being a <span class="locked">decad<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> composed
of some intelligible entities.</p>

<h3>NUMBER EXISTS BEFORE EVERY ANIMAL, AND THE
UNIVERSAL ANIMAL.</h3>

<p>15. (From the above discussion about the intelligibility
of numbers) let us now return to what we
said in the beginning. The universal (Being) is
veritable Essence, Intelligence, and perfect living Organism;
and at the same time contains also all the
living organisms. Our universe, which also is an organism,
by its unity imitates so far as it can the unity
of the perfect living Organism. I say, to the extent of
its capacity, because, by its nature, the sense-world has
departed from the unity of the intelligible world;
otherwise, it would not be the sense-world. Moreover,
the universal living Organism must be the universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">669</a></span>
Number; for if it were not a perfect number, it
would lack some number; and if it did not contain the
total number of living organisms, it would not be the
perfect living Organism. Number therefore exists before
every living organism, and before the universal
living Organism. Man and the other living organisms
are in the intelligible world; so far as they are living
organisms, and so far as the intelligible world is the
universal living Organism; for man, even here below,
is a part of the living Organism, so far as itself is a
living organism, and as the living Organism is universal;
the other living organisms are also in the living
Organism, so far as each of them is a living organism.</p>

<h3>THE INTELLIGIBLE AS POTENTIAL AND ACTUALIZED
IN THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>Likewise, Intelligence, as such, contains all the individual
intelligences as its <span class="locked">parts.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span> These, however,
form a number. Consequently, the number which is
in the Intelligence does not occupy the first degree.
So far as the number is in Intelligence, it is equal to the
quantity of the actualizations of Intelligence. Now,
these actualizations are wisdom, justice, and the other
virtues, science, and all the (ideas) whose possession
characterizes it as veritable Intelligence. (If then
science exist in the Intelligence) how does it happen
that it is not there in some principle other than itself?
In Intelligence the knower, the known, and science are
one and the same thing; and with everything else
within it. That is why every (entity) exists in the
intelligible world in its highest degree. For instance,
within it, Justice is no accident, though it be one in
the soul, as such; for intelligible entities are in the soul
(only in) potential condition (so long as she remains
no more than soul); and they are actualized when the
soul rises to Intelligence and dwells with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">670</a></span><a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<h3>NUMBER AS THE UNIVERSAL BOND OF THE
UNIVERSE.</h3>

<p>Besides Intelligence, and anterior thereto, exists
Essence. It contains Number, with which it begets
(beings); for it begets them by moving according to
number, determining upon the numbers before giving
hypostatic existence to the (beings), just as the unity
(of essence) precedes its (existence), and interrelates
it with the First (or, absolute Unity). Numbers interrelate
nothing else to the First; it suffices for Essence
to be interrelated with Him, because Essence, on becoming
Number, attaches all (beings) to itself. Essence
is divided not so far as it is a unity (for its unity
is permanent); but having divided itself conformably
to its nature in as many things as it decided on, it saw
into how many things it had divided itself; and through
this (process) it begat the number that exists within
itself; for it divided itself by virtue of the potentialities
of number, and it begat as many (beings) as number
comported.</p>

<h3>THE GENERATION OF EVERYTHING REGULATED
BY NUMBER.</h3>

<p>The first and veritable Number is therefore the
source and <span class="locked">principle<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> of hypostatic existence for
beings. That is the reason that even here below, the
classified both discrete and continuous <span class="locked">quantity<a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span>
and, with a different number, it is some other thing
that is begotten, or nothing more can be begotten.
Such are the primary Numbers, so far as they can be
numbered. The numbers that subsist in other things
play two parts. So far as they proceed from the
First, they can be numbered; so far as they are below
them, they measure other things, they serve to enumerate
both numbers and things which can be enumerated.
How indeed could you even say "ten" without
the aid of numbers within yourself?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">671</a></span></p>

<h3>DIFFICULTIES CONNECTED WITH THESE INTELLIGIBLE
NUMBERS.</h3>

<p>16. The first objection might be, Where do you
locate, or how do you classify these primary and veritable
Numbers? All the philosophers (who follow
Aristotle) classify numbers in the genus of quantity.
It seems that we have above treated of quantity, and
classified both discrete and continuous <span class="locked">quantity<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span>
among other "beings." Here however we seem to
say that these Numbers form part of the primary
Essences, and add that there are, in addition, numbers
that serve for enumerations. We are now asked how
we make these statements agree, for they seem to give
rise to several questions. Is the unity which is found
among sense-beings a quantity? Or is unity a quantity
when repeated, while, when considered alone and
in itself, it is the principle of quantity, but not a quantity
itself? Besides, if unity be the principle of
quantity, does it share the nature of quantity, or has it
a different nature? Here are a number of points we
ought to expound. We shall answer these questions,
and here is what we consider our starting-point.</p>

<h3>UNITY CONTAINED IN SENSE-OBJECTS IS NOT
UNITY IN ITSELF.</h3>

<p>When, considering visible objects, by which we
ought to begin, we combine one (being) with another,
as for instance, a horse and a dog, or two men, and
say that they form two; or, when considering a greater
number of men we say they are ten, and form a group
of ten, this number does not constitute being, nor an
(accident) among sense-objects; it is purely and simply
a quantity. Dividing this group of ten by unity, and
making unity of its parts, you obtain and constitute
the principle of quantity (unity) for a unity thus derived
from a group of ten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">672</a></span></p>

<h3>NUMERALS PREDICATED OF THE MAN IN HIMSELF
ARE ESSENTIAL.</h3>

<p>But when you say that the Man considered in himself
is a number, as, for instance, a pair, because he is
both animal and reasonable, we have here no more
than a simple modality. For, while reasoning and
enumerating we produce a quantity; but so far as
there are here two things (animal and reasonable), and
as each of them is one, as each completes the being
of the man, and possesses unity; we are here using
and proclaiming another kind of number, the essential
Number. Here the pair is not posterior to things; it
does not limit itself to expressing a quantity which is
exterior to essence; it expresses what is in the very
being of this essence, and contains its nature.</p>

<h3>COLLECTIVE NOUNS USED AS PROOF OF
INDEPENDENT EXISTENCE.</h3>

<p>Indeed, it is not you who here below produce number
when you by discursive reason range through things
that exist by themselves, and which do not depend for
their existence on your enumeration; for you add
nothing to the being of a man by enumerating him
with another. That is no unity, as in a "choric ballet."
When you say, ten men, "ten" exists only in you who
are enumerating. We could not assert that "ten"
exists in the ten men you are enumerating, because
these men are not co-ordinated so as to form a unity;
it is you yourself who produce ten by enumerating this
group of ten, and by making up a quantity. But when
you say, a "choric ballet," an "army," there is something
which exists outside of these objects, and within
<span class="locked">yourself.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span> How are we to understand that the number
exists in you? The number which existed in you
before you made the enumeration has another mode
(of existence) (than the number that you produce by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">673</a></span>
enumeration). As to the number which manifests
itself in exterior objects and refers to the number
within yourself, it constitutes an actualization of the
essential numbers, or, is conformable to the essential
Numbers; for, while enumerating you produce a
number, and by this actualization you give hypostatic
existence to quantity, as in walking you did to movement.</p>

<h3>THE NUMBER WITHIN IS THE NUMBER CONSTITUTIVE
OF OUR BEING.</h3>

<p>In what sense does the number which is within us
(before we enumerate) have a mode (of existence)
other (than the one we produce in enumeration)?
Because it is the number constitutive of our being,
which, as Plato <span class="locked">says,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> participates in number and
harmony, and is a number and harmony; for the soul
is said to be neither a body nor an extension; she
therefore is a number, since she is a being. The number
of the body is a being of the same nature as the
body; the number of the soul consists in the beings
which are incorporeal like souls. Then, for the intelligible
entities, if the animal itself be plurality, if it be
a triad, the triad that exists in the animal is essential.
As to the triad which subsists, not in the animal, but
in essence, it is the principle of being. If you enumerate
the animal and the beautiful, each of these two
in itself is a unity; but (in enumerating them), you
beget number in yourself, and you conceive a certain
quantity, the pair. If (like the Pythagoreans) you say
that virtue is a group of four, or tetrad, it is one so far
as its parts (justice, prudence, courage, and temperance)
contribute to the formation of a unity; you may
add that this group of four, or tetrad, is a unity, so far
as it is a kind of substrate; as to you, you connect this
tetrad with the one that is inside of you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">674</a></span><a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<h3>HOW A NUMBER MAY BE CALLED <span class="locked">INFINITE.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span></h3>

<p>17. As the reasons here advanced would seem to
imply that every number is limited, we may ask in
which sense may a number be said to be infinite?
This conclusion is right, for it is against the nature of
number to be infinite. Why do people then often
speak of a number as infinite? Is it in the same sense
that one calls a line infinite? A line is said to be infinite,
not that there really exists an infinite line of
this kind, but to imply the conception of a line as
great as possible, greater than any given line. Similarly
with number. When we know which is the number
(of certain objects), we can double it by thought,
without, on that account, adding any other number
to the first. How indeed would it be possible to add
to exterior objects the conception of our imagination,
a conception that exists in ourselves exclusively? We
shall therefore say that, among intelligible entities, a
line is infinite; otherwise, the intelligible line would
be a simple quantative expression. If however the
intelligible line be not this, it must be infinite in number;
but we then understand the word "infinite" in a
sense other than that of having no limits that could
not be transcended. In what sense then is the word
"infinite" here used? In the sense that the conception
of a limit is not implied in the being of a line in
itself.</p>

<h3>INTELLIGIBLE LINE POSTERIOR TO NUMBER, AND
EXISTS IN THE INTELLIGIBLE.</h3>

<p>What then is the intelligible line, and where does it
exist? It is posterior to <span class="locked">number<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span>; for unity appears
in the line, since this starts from the unity (of the
point), and because it has but one dimension (length);
now the measure of dimension is not a quantative
(entity). Where then does the intelligible Line exist?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">675</a></span>
It exists only in the intelligence that defines it; or, if
it be a thing, it is but something intellectual. In the
intelligible world, in fact, everything is intellectual,
and such as the thing itself is. It is in this same world,
likewise, where is made the decision where and how
the plane, the solid, and all other figures are to be
disposed. For it is not we who create the figures by
conceiving them. This is so because the figure of the
world is anterior to us, and because the natural figures
which are suitable to the productions of nature, are
necessarily anterior to the bodies, and in the intelligible
world exist in the state of primary figures, without determining
limits, for these forms exist in no other
subjects; they subsist by themselves, and have no need
of extension, because the extension is the attribute of
a subject.</p>

<h3>THE INTELLIGIBLE SPHERICAL FIGURE THE
PRIMITIVE ONE.</h3>

<p>Everywhere, therefore, in essence, is a single
(spherical) <span class="locked">figure,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span> and each of these figures (which
this single figure implicitly contained) has become distinct,
either in, or before the animal. When I say that
each figure has become distinct, I do not mean that it
has become an extension, but that it has been assigned
to some particular animal; thus, in the intelligible
world, each body has been assigned its own characteristic
figure, as, for instance, the pyramid to the <span class="locked">fire.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span>
Our world seeks to imitate this figure, although it cannot
accomplish this, because of matter. There are
other figures here below that are analogous to the intelligible
figures.</p>

<h3>FIGURES PRE-EXIST IN THE INTELLIGIBLE.</h3>

<p>But are the figures in the living Organism as such,
or, if it cannot be doubted that they are in the living
Organism, do they anteriorly exist in the Intelligence?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">676</a></span>
If the Organism contained Intelligence, the figures
would be in the first degree in the Organism. But as
it is the Intelligence that contains the Organism, they
are in the first degree in Intelligence. Besides, as the
souls are contained in the perfect living Organism, it is
one reason more for the priority of the Intelligence.
But Plato <span class="locked">says,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> "Intelligence sees the Ideas comprised
within the perfect living Organism." Now,
if it see the Ideas contained in the perfect living Organism,
Intelligence must be posterior to the latter.
By the words "it sees" it should be understood that the
existence of the living Organism itself is realized in
this vision. Indeed, the Intelligence which sees is not
something different from the Organism which is seen;
but (in Intelligence) all things form but one. Only,
thought has a pure and simple sphere, while the Organism
has an animated <span class="locked">sphere.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span></p>

<h3>INFINITY IN NUMBER ARISES FROM POSSIBILITY
OF INCREASING GREATEST IMAGINABLE
PHYSICAL NUMBER.</h3>

<p>18. Thus, in the intelligible world, every number
is finite. But we can conceive of a number greater
than any assigned number, and thus it is that our mind,
while considering the numbers, produces the (notion
of the) infinite. On the contrary, in the intelligible
world, it is impossible to conceive a number greater
than the Number conceived (by divine Intelligence);
for on high Number exists eternally; no Number is
lacking, or could ever lack, so that one could never
add anything thereto.</p>

<h3>AS UNMEASURED THE INTELLIGIBLE NUMBER
MIGHT BE CALLED INFINITE.</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, the intelligible Number might be called
infinite in the sense that it is unmeasured. By what,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">677</a></span>
indeed, could it be measured? The Number that exists
on high is universal, simultaneous one and manifold,
constituting a whole circumscribed by no limit (a
whole that is infinite); it is what it is by itself. None
of the intelligible beings, indeed, is circumscribed by
any limit. What is really limited and measured is
what is hindered from losing itself in the infinite, and
demands measure. But all of the intelligible (beings)
are measures; whence it results that they are all
beautiful. So far as it is a living organism, the living
Organism in itself is beautiful, possessing an excellent
life, and lacking no kind of life; it does not have a life
mingled with death, it contains nothing mortal nor
perishable. The life of the living Organism in itself
has no fault; it is the first Life, full of vigor and
energy, a primary Light whose rays vivify both the
souls that dwell on high, and those that descend here
below. This Life knows why it lives; it knows its
principle and its goal; for its principle is simultaneously
its goal. Besides, universal Wisdom, the universal Intelligence,
which is intimately united to the living
Organism, which subsists in it and with it, still improves
it; heightening its hues as it were by the
splendor of its wisdom, and rendering its beauty more
venerable. Even here below, a life full of wisdom
is that which is most venerable and beautiful, though
we can hardly catch a glimpse of such a life. On high,
however, the vision of life is perfectly clear; the
(favored initiate) receives from Life both capacity to
behold and increased vitality; so that, thanks to a
more energetic life, the beholder receives a clearer
vision, and he becomes what he sees. Here below, our
glance often rests on inanimate things, and even when
it turns towards living beings, it first notices in them
that which lacks life. Besides, the life which is hidden
in them is already mingled with other things. On
high, on the contrary, all the (beings) are alive, entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">678</a></span>
alive, and their life is pure. If at the first aspect
you should look on something as deprived of life, soon
the life within it would burst out before your eyes.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE ALONE POSSESSES SELF-EXISTENCE.</h3>

<p>Contemplate therefore the Being that penetrates the
intelligibles, and which communicates to them an immutable
life; contemplate the Wisdom and Knowledge
that resides within them, and you will not be able to
keep from deriding this inferior nature to which the
vulgar human beings attribute genuine "being." It is
in this supreme "Being" that dwell life and intelligence,
and that the essences subsist in eternity. There,
nothing issues (from Essence), nothing changes or
agitates it; for there is nothing outside of it that could
reach it; if a single thing existed outside of ("being"),
("being") would be dependent on it. If anything
opposed to (essence) existed, this thing would escape
the action of ("being"); it would no longer owe its
existence to ("being"), but would constitute a common
principle anterior to it, and would be essence.
<span class="locked">Parmenides<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span> therefore was right in saying that the
Essence was one; that it was immutable, not because
there was nothing else (that could modify it), but
because it was essence. Alone, therefore, does Essence
possess self-existence. How then could one, to
Essence, refuse to attribute existence, or any of the
things of which it is an actualization, and which it
constitutes? So long as it exists, it gives them to itself;
and since it exists always, these things therefore
eternally subsist within it.</p>

<h3>THE POWER AND BEAUTY OF ESSENCE IS TO
ATTRACT ALL THINGS.</h3>

<p>Such are the power and beauty of Essence that it
(charms and) attracts all things, holding them as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">679</a></span>
were suspended, so that these are delighted to possess
even a trace of its perfection, and seek nothing beyond,
except the Good. For Essence is anterior to the Good
in respect to us (when we climb up from here below to
the intelligible world). The entire intelligible world
aspires to the Life and Wisdom so as to possess existence;
all the souls, all the intelligences likewise aspire
to possess it; Essence alone is fully self-sufficient.</p>

<span class="slarger">(OF PERSPECTIVE.)</span></h2>

<h3>VARIOUS THEORIES OF PERSPECTIVE.</h3>

<p>1. What is the cause that when distant visible objects
seem smaller, and that, though separated by a
great space, they seem to be close to each other, while
if close, we see them in their true size, and their true
distance? The cause of objects seeming smaller at a
distance might be that light needs to be focussed near
the eye, and to be accommodated to the size of the
<span class="locked">pupils<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span>; that the greater the distance of the matter of
the visible object, the more does its form seem to
separate from it during its transit to the eyes; and that,
as there is a form of quantity as well as of quality, it
is the reason (or, form) of the latter which alone
reaches the eye. On the other hand, (Epicurus)
thinks that we feel magnitude only by the passage and
the successive introduction of its parts, one by one;
and that, consequently, magnitude must be brought
within our reach, and near us, for us to determine its
quantity.</p>

<h3>QUALITY IS MORE ESSENTIAL THAN QUANTITY.</h3>

<p>(Do objects at a distance seem smaller) because we
perceive magnitude only by accident, and because color
is perceived first? In this case, when an object is
near, we perceive its colored magnitude; when at a
distance, we perceive first its color, not well enough
distinguishing its parts to gather exact knowledge of its
quantity, because its colors are less lively. Why should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">681</a></span>
we be surprised at magnitudes being similar to sounds,
which grow weaker as their form decreases in distinctness?
As to sounds, indeed, it is the form that
is sought by the sense of hearing, and here intensity
is noticed only as an accident. But if hearing perceive
magnitude only by accident, to what faculty
shall we attribute the primitive perception of intensity
in sound, just as primitive perception of magnitude in
the visible object is referable to the sense of touch?
Hearing perceives apparent magnitude by determining
not the quantity but the intensity of sounds; this very
intensity of sounds, however, is perceived only by accident
(because it is its proper object). Likewise,
taste does not by accident feel the intensity of a sweet
savor. Speaking strictly, the magnitude of a sound is
its extent. Now the intensity of a sound indicates its
extent only by accident, and therefore in an inexact
manner. Indeed a thing's intensity is identical with the
thing itself. The multitude of a thing's parts is known
only by the extent of space occupied by the object.</p>

<h3>DIFFERENCES OF COLOR AID IN THE PERCEPTION
OF MAGNITUDE.</h3>

<p>It may be objected that a color cannot be less large,
and that it can only be less vivid. However, there is
a common characteristic in something smaller and less
vivid; namely, that it is less than what it is its being
to be. As to color, diminution implies weakness; as to
size, smallness. Magnitude connected with color
diminishes proportionally with it. This is evident in
the perception of a varied object, as, for instance, in
the perception of mountains covered with houses,
forests, and many other objects; here the distinctness
of detail affords a standard by which to judge of the
whole. But when the view of the details does not
impress itself on the eye, the latter no longer grasps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">682</a></span>
the extent of the whole through measurement of the
extent offered to its contemplation by the details.
Even in the case where the objects are near and varied,
if we include them all in one glance without distinguishing
all their parts, the more parts our glance loses, the
smaller do the objects seem. On the contrary, if we
distinguish all their details, the more exactly do we
measure them, and learn their real size. Magnitudes
of uniform color deceive the eye because the latter
can no longer measure their extent by its parts; and
because, even if the eye attempt to do so, it loses itself,
not knowing where to stop, for lack of difference between
the parts.</p>

<h3>DISAPPEARANCE OF THE FORM IMPLIES THAT OF
THE SIZE.</h3>

<p>The distant object seems to us close because our
inability to distinguish the parts of the intervening
space does not permit us to determine exactly its magnitude.
When sight can no longer traverse the length
of an interval by determining its quality, in respect to
its form, neither can it any longer determine its quantity
in respect to magnitude.</p>

<h3>REFUTATION OF ARISTOTLE'S "VISUAL ANGLE"
THEORY.</h3>

<p>2. <span class="locked">Some<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> hold that distant objects seem to us
lesser only because they are seen under a smaller visual
angle. <span class="locked">Elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span> we have shown that this is wrong;
and here we shall limit ourselves to the following considerations.
The assertion that a distant object seems
less because it is perceived under a smaller visual angle
supposes that the rest of the eye still sees something
outside of this object, whether this be some other
object, or something external, such as the air. But if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">683</a></span>
we suppose that the eye sees nothing outside of this
object, whether this object, as would a great mountain,
occupy the whole extent of the glance, and permit
nothing beyond it to be seen; or whether it even extend
beyond the sweep of the glance on both sides, then this
object should not, as it actually does, seem smaller
than it really is, even though it fill the whole extension
of the glance. The truth of this observation can be
verified by a mere glance at the sky. Not in a single
glance can the whole hemisphere be perceived, for the
glance could not be extended widely enough to embrace
so vast an expanse. Even if we grant the possibility
of this, and that the whole glance embraces the
whole hemisphere; still the real magnitude of the
heaven is greater than its apparent magnitude. How
then by the diminution of the visual angle could we
explain the smallness of the apparent magnitude of
the sky, on the hypothesis that it is the diminution of
the visual angle which makes distant objects appear
smaller?</p>

<span class="smaller">Does Happiness Increase With Time?<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span></h2>

<h3>HAPPINESS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DURATION
OF TIME.</h3>

<p>1. Does happiness increase with duration of time?
No: for the feeling of happiness exists only in the
present. The memory of past happiness could not add
anything to happiness itself. Happiness is not a word,
but a state of soul. But a state of soul is a present
(experience), such as, for instance, the actualization
of life.</p>

<h3>HAPPINESS IS NOT THE SATISFACTION OF THE
DESIRE TO LIVE.</h3>

<p>2. Might happiness not be the satisfaction of the
desire of living and activity, inasmuch as this desire is
ever present with us? (Hardly). First, according to
this hypothesis, the happiness of to-morrow would ever
be greater than that of to-day, and that of the following
day than that of the day before, and so on to
infinity. In this case, the measure of happiness would
no longer be virtue (but duration). Then, the
beatitude of the divinities will also have to become
greater from day to day; it would no longer be perfect,
and could never become <span class="locked">so.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span> Besides, desire finds its
satisfaction in the possession of what is present, both
now, and in the future. So long as these present circumstances
exist, their possession constitutes happiness.
Further, as the desire of living can be no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">685</a></span>
than the desire to exist, the latter desire can refer to
the present only, inasmuch as real existence (essence)
inheres only in the present. Desire for a future time,
or for some later event, means no more than a desire
to preserve what one already possesses. Desire refers
neither to the future nor the past, but to what exists
at present. What is sought is not a perpetual progression
in the future, but the enjoyment of what exists
from the present moment onward.</p>

<h3>INCREASED HAPPINESS WOULD RESULT ONLY
FROM MORE PERFECT GRASP.</h3>

<p>3. What shall be said of him who lived happily
during a longer period, who has longer contemplated
the same spectacle? If such longer contemplation resulted
in a clearer idea thereof, the length of time has
served some useful purpose; but if the agent contemplated
it in the same manner for the whole extent of
time, he possesses no advantage over him who contemplated
it only once.</p>

<h3>PLEASURE IS UNCONNECTED WITH HAPPINESS.</h3>

<p>4. It might be objected that the former of these
men enjoyed pleasure longer than the other. This
consideration has nothing to do with happiness. If
by this (enjoyed) pleasure we mean the free exercise
(of intelligence), the pleasure referred to is then identical
with the happiness here meant. This higher
pleasure referred to is only to possess what is here ever
present; what of it is past is of no further value.</p>

<h3>LENGTH OF HAPPINESS DOES NOT AFFECT ITS
QUALITY.</h3>

<p>5. Would equal happiness be predicated of three
men, one who had been happy from his life's beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">686</a></span>
to its end, the other only at its end, and the third, who
had been happy, but who ceased being <span class="locked">such.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span> This
comparison is not between three men who are happy,
but between one man who is happy, with two who are
deprived of happiness, and that at the (present
moment) when happiness (counts most). If then one
of them have any advantage, he possesses it as a man
actually happy compared with such as are not; he
therefore surpasses the two others by the actual possession
of happiness.</p>

<h3>IF UNHAPPINESS INCREASE WITH TIME, WHY
SHOULD NOT HAPPINESS DO SO?</h3>

<p>6. (It is generally agreed that) all calamities, sufferings,
griefs and similar evils are aggravated in proportion
to their duration. If then, in all these cases,
evil be increased with time, why should not the same
circumstance obtain in the contrary case? Why should
happiness also not be increased?<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Referring to griefs
and sufferings, it might reasonably be said that they are
increased by duration. When, for example, sickness is
prolonged, and becomes a habitual condition, the body
suffers more and more profoundly as time goes on.
If, however, evil ever remain at the same degree, it
does not grow worse, and there is no need of complaining
but of the present. Consideration of the past evil
amounts to considering the traces left by evil, the
morbid disposition whose intensity is increased by time,
because its seriousness is proportionate to its duration.
In this case it is not the length of time, but the aggravation
of the evil which adds to the misfortune. But
the new degree (of intensity) does not subsist simultaneously
with the old, and it is unreasonable to predicate
an increase as summation of what is no more to
what now is. On the contrary, it is the fixed characteristic
of happiness to have a fixed term, to remain ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">687</a></span>
the same. Here also the only increase possibly due
to duration of time depends on the relation between an
increase in virtue and one in happiness; and the element
to be reckoned with here is not the number of years of
happiness, but the degree of virtue finally acquired.</p>

<h3>AS ADDITION IS POSSIBLE WITH TIME, WHY CANNOT
HAPPINESS INCREASE?</h3>

<p>7. It might be objected that it is inconsistent to
consider the present only, exclusive of the past (as
in the case of happiness), when we do not do so in
respect of time. For the addition of past to present
unquestionably lengthens time. If then we may
properly say that time becomes longer, why may we
not say the same of happiness?&mdash;Were we to do so,
we would be applying happiness to divisions of time,
while it is precisely to bring out the indivisibility of
happiness that it is considered to be measured by the
present exclusively. While considering time, in respect
of things that have vanished, such as, for instance,
the dead, it is perfectly reasonable to reckon
the past; but it would be unreasonable to compare past
happiness with present happiness in respect to duration,
because it would be treating happiness as something
accidental and temporary. Whatever might be the
length of time that preceded the present, all that can
be said of it is, that it is no more. To regard duration
while considering happiness is to try to disperse and
fraction something that is one and indivisible, something
that exists only in the present. That is why time
is called an image of eternity, inasmuch as it tends to
destroy eternity's permanence through its own <span class="locked">dispersion.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span>
By abstracting permanence from eternity,
and appropriating it, time destroys eternity; for a short
period, permanence may survive in association with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">688</a></span>
time; but as soon as it becomes fused with it, eternity
perishes. Now as happiness consists in the enjoyment
of a life that is good, namely in that which is proper
to Essence (in itself), because none better exists, it
must, instead of time, have, as a measure, eternity itself,
a principle which admits neither increase nor
diminution, which cannot be compared to any length,
whose nature it is to be indivisible, and superior to
time. No comparison, therefore, should be instituted
between essence and non-essence, eternity and time,
the perpetual and the eternal; nor should extension be
predicated of the indivisible. If we regard existence
of Essence in itself, it will be necessary to regard it
entire; to consider it, not as the perpetuity of time,
but as the very life of eternity, a life which instead of
consisting of a series of centuries, exists entire since
all centuries.</p>

<h3>NOT EVEN MEMORIES OF THE PAST INCREASE
HAPPINESS.</h3>

<p>8. Somebody might object that by subsisting till
the present, the memory of the past adds something
more to him who has long lived happily. In this case
it will be necessary to examine what is meant by this
memory. If it mean the memory of former wisdom,
and if it mean that he who would possess this memory
would become wiser on account of it, then this memory
differs from our question (which studies happiness,
and not wisdom). If it mean the memory of pleasure,
it would imply that the happy man has need of much
pleasure, and cannot remain satisfied with what is
present. Besides, there is no proof that the memory
of a past pleasure is at all pleasant; on the contrary,
it would be entirely ridiculous to remember with delight
having tasted a delicious dish the day before, and still
more ridiculous remembering such an enjoyment ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">689</a></span>
years ago. It would be just as ridiculous to pride one
self on having been a wise man last year.</p>

<h3>NOT EVEN THE MEMORY OF VIRTUE INCREASES
HAPPINESS.</h3>

<p>9. Could not the memory of virtuous actions contribute
to happiness? No: for such a memory cannot
exist in a man who has no virtue at present, and who
thereby is driven to seek out the memory of past
virtues.</p>

<h3>LENGTH OF TIME IS OF NO IMPORTANCE, NOT
EVEN AS OPPORTUNITY OF VIRTUE.</h3>

<p>10. Another objection is that length of time would
give opportunity for doing many beautiful deeds; while
this opportunity is denied him who lives happily only
a short period. This may be answered by denying
happiness to a man on the grounds of having done
many beautiful deeds. If several parts of time and
several actions are to constitute happiness, then it
would be constituted by things that are no more, that
are past, and by present things; whereas our definition
of happiness limits it exclusively to the present. Then
we considered whether length of time add to happiness.
There remains only to examine whether happiness
of long duration be superior because of yielding
opportunities of doing more beautiful deeds. To begin
with, the man who is inactive may be just as happy, if
not more happy than he who is active. Besides, it is
not actions themselves which yield happiness; (the
sources of happiness) are states of mind, which are
the principles of beautiful actions. The wise man
enjoys welfare while active, but not because of this
activity; he derives (this welfare) not from contingent
things, but from what he possesses in himself. For it
might happen even to a vicious man to save his fatherland,
or to feel pleasure in seeing it saved by some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">690</a></span>
other. It is not then these activities which are the
causes of the enjoyment of happiness. True beatitude
and the joys it yields must be derived from the constant
disposition of the soul. To predicate it of activity,
would be to make it depend on things alien to virtue
and the soul. The soul's actualization consists in being
wise, and in exercising her self-activity; this is true
happiness.</p>

<span class="smaller">About Mixture to the Point of Total Penetration.</span></h2>

<h3>REFUTATION OF ANAXAGORAS AND DEMOCRITUS.</h3>

<p>1. The subject of the present consideration is mixture
to the point of total penetration of the different
bodies. This has been explained in two ways: that the
two liquids are mingled so as mutually to interpenetrate
each other totally, or that only one of them penetrates
the other. The difference between these two theories
is of small importance. First we must set aside the
opinion of (Anaxagoras and <span class="locked">Democritus<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span>), who explain
mixture as a juxtaposition, because this is a crude
combination, rather than a <span class="locked">mixture.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span> Mixture should
render the whole homogeneous, so that even the smallest
molecules might each be composed of the various
elements of the mixture.</p>

<h3>REFUTATION OF ARISTOTLE AND ALEXANDER OF
APHRODISIAS.</h3>

<p>As to the (Peripatetic) philosophers who assert that
in a mixture only the qualities mingle, while the
material extension of both bodies are only in juxtaposition,
so long as the qualities proper to each of them
are spread throughout the whole mass, they seem to
establish the rightness of their opinion by attacking the
doctrine which asserts that the two bodies mutually
interpenetrate in <span class="locked">mixture.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span> (They object) that the
molecules of both bodies will finally lose all magnitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">692</a></span>
by this continuous division which will leave no interval
between the parts of either of the two bodies; for if
the two bodies mutually interpenetrate each other in
every part, their division must become continuous.
Besides, the mixture often occupies an extent greater
than each body taken separately, and as great as if
mere juxtaposition had occurred. Now if two bodies
mutually interpenetrate totally, the resulting mixture
would occupy no more place than any one of them
taken separately. The case where two bodies occupy
no more space than a single one of them is by these
philosophers explained by the air's expulsion, which
permits one of the bodies to penetrate into the pores
of the other. Besides, in the case of the mixture of
two bodies of unequal extent, how could the body of
the smaller extend itself sufficiently to spread into all
the parts of the greater? There are many other such
reasons.</p>

<h3>REFUTATION OF THE STOICS.</h3>

<p>We now pass to the opinions of (Zeno and the
other Stoic) <span class="locked">philosophers,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span> who assert that two bodies
which make up a mixture mutually interpenetrate each
other totally. They support this view by observing
that when the bodies interpenetrate totally, they
are divided without the occurrence of a continuous
division (which would make their molecules lose
their magnitude). Indeed, perspiration issues from
the human body without its being divided or riddled
with holes. To this it may be objected that nature
may have endowed our body with a disposition
to permit perspiration to issue easily. To this (the
Stoics) answer that certain substances (like <span class="locked">ivory<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span>),
which when worked into thin sheets, admit, in all their
parts, a liquid (oat-gruel) which passes from one surface
to the other. As these substances are bodies, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">693</a></span>
is not easy to understand how one element can penetrate
into another without separating its molecules. On
the other hand, total division must imply mutual
destruction (because their molecules would lose all
magnitude whatever). When, however, two mingled
bodies do not together occupy more space than either
of them separately (the Stoics) seem forced to admit
to their adversaries that this phenomenon is caused by
the displacement of air.</p>

<h3>EXPLANATION OF MIXTURE THAT OCCUPIES MORE
SPACE THAN ITS ELEMENTS.</h3>

<p>In the case where the compound occupies more
space than each element separately, it might (though
with little probability), be asserted, that, since every
body, along with its other qualities, implies size, a
local extension must take place. No more than the
other qualities could this increase perish. Since, out of
both qualities, arises a new form, as a compound of the
mixture of both qualities; so also must another size
arise, the mixture combining the size out of both.
Here (the Peripatetics) might answer (the Stoics):
"If you assert a juxtaposition of substances, as well
as of the masses which possess extension, you are
actually adopting our opinions. If however one of the
masses, with its former extension, penetrate the entire
mass of the other, the extension, instead of increasing,
as in the case where one line is added to another by
joining their extremities, will not increase any more
than when two straight lines are made to coincide by
superimposing one on the other."</p>

<h3>CASE OF MIXTURE OF UNEQUAL QUANTITIES.</h3>

<p>The case of the mixture of a smaller quantity with a
greater one, such as of a large body with a very small
one, leads (the Peripatetics) to consider it impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">694</a></span>
that the great body should spread in all the parts of
the small one. Where the mixture is not evident, the
(Peripatetics) might claim that the smaller body does
not unite with all the parts of the greater. When
however the mixture is evident, they can explain it by
the extension of the masses, although it be very doubtful
that a small mass would assume so great an extension,
especially when we attribute to the composite
body a greater extent, without nevertheless admitting
its transformation, as when water transforms itself
into air.</p>

<h3>EVAPORATION MAY LEAD TO A THIRD THEORY
OF MIXTURE.</h3>

<p>2. What happens when a mass of water transforms
itself into air? This question demands particular
treatment; for how can the transformed element occupy
a greater extension? (We shall not try to explain
it on either the Peripatetic or Stoic principles)
because we have sufficiently developed above the
numerous reasons advanced by both those schools.
We had better now consider which of the two systems
we ourselves might adopt, and on which side lies
reason. Besides, we should consider whether, besides
these both, there be not place for a third opinion.</p>

<h3>REFUTATION OF STOIC EXPLANATION OF
EVAPORATION.</h3>

<p>When water flows through wool, or when paper
allows water to filter through it, why does not the
whole of the water pass through these substances (without
partly remaining within them)? If the water remain
therein partially, we shall not be able to unite the
two substances or masses. Shall we say that the qualities
alone are confused (or, mingled)? Water is not
in juxtaposition with the paper, nor is lodged in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">695</a></span>
pores; for the whole paper is penetrated thereby, and
no portion of the matter lacks that quality. If matter be
united to quality everywhere, water must everywhere
be present in the paper. If it be not water that everywhere
is present in the paper, but only (humidity
which is) the quality of the water, where then is the
water itself? Why is not the mass the same? The
matter that has insinuated itself into the paper extends
it, and increases its volume. Now this augmentation
of volume implies augmentation of mass; and
the latter implies that the water has not been absorbed
by the book, and that the two substances occupy different
places (and do not interpenetrate each other).
Since one body causes another to participate in its
quality, why would it not also make it participate in its
extension? By virtue of this union with a different
quality, one quality, united with a different one, cannot,
either remain pure, or preserve its earlier nature; it
necessarily becomes weaker. But one extension, added
to another extension, does not vanish.</p>

<h3>REFUTATION OF PERIPATETIC EXPLANATION
OF EVAPORATION.</h3>

<p>One body is said to divide another, by penetrating it.
This assertion, however, demands demonstration, for
it is more reasonable to suppose that qualities may
penetrate a body without dividing it. Such demonstration
is attempted by the claim that qualities are <span class="locked">incorporeal.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span>
But if matter itself be as incorporeal as the
qualities, why could not some qualities along with the
matter penetrate into some other body? That some
solids do not penetrate other bodies, is due to their possession
of qualities incompatible with that of penetration.
The objection that many qualities could not,
along with matter, penetrate some body, would be
justified only if it were the multitude of qualities that
produced density; but if density be as much of a quality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">696</a></span>
as corporeity, the qualities will constitute the mixture
not in themselves alone, but only as they happen to be
determined. On the other hand, when matter does not
lend itself to mixture, this occurs not by virtue of its
being matter, but as matter united to some determinative
quality. That is all the truer as matter is receptive
to any magnitude, not having any of its own. But
enough of this.</p>

<h3>THE BODY IS RATIONALIZED MATTER.</h3>

<p>3. Since we have spoken of corporeity, it must be
analyzed. Is it a composite of all qualities, or does it
constitute a form, a "reason," which produces the body
by presence in matter? If the body be the composite
of all the qualities together with matter, this totality
of qualities will constitute corporeity. But if corporeity
be a reason which produces the body by approaching
matter, doubtless it is a reason which contains all the
qualities. Now, if this reason be not at all a definition
of being, if it be a reason productive of the object, it
will not contain any matter. It is the reason which applies
itself to matter, and which, by its presence, produces
the body there. Body is matter with indwelling
"reason." This "reason," being a form, may be considered
separately from matter, even if it were entirely
inseparable therefrom. Indeed, "reason" separated
(from matter), and residing in intelligence, is different
(from "reason" united to matter); the "Reason"
which abides within Intelligence is Intelligence itself.

a result of this knowledge, to keep them from perishing,
He granted them, as tools, senses and organs. In
our turn we shall ask whether the divinity gave the
organs to the living organisms that already possessed
the senses, or whether, He endowed souls with senses
and organs simultaneously. In the latter case, though
they were souls, they did not previously possess the
sensitive faculties. But if the souls possessed the sensitive
faculties since the time they were produced, and
if they were produced (with these faculties) in order
to descend into generation, then it was natural for
them to do so. In this case it seems that it must be
contrary to their nature to avoid generation, and to
dwell in the intelligible world. They would seem made
to belong to the body, and to live in evil. Thus divine
Providence would retain them in evil, and the divinity
would arrive at this result by reasoning; in any case,
He would have reasoned.</p>

<h3>FORESIGHT OF CREATION IS NOT THE RESULT OF
REASONING.</h3>

<p>If the divinity reason, we are forced to wonder
what are the principles of this reasoning; for, if it were
objected that these principles are derived from some
other reasoning, we shall, nevertheless, in the process
of ascending, have to find something anterior to all
reasoning; namely, a point of departure. Now from
whence are the principles of reasoning derived? Either
from the senses or the intelligence. (Could the divinity
have made use of principles derived from the senses?)
(When God created) there were no senses in existence
yet; therefore (the divinity must have reasoned) from
principles derived from Intelligence. But if the
premises were conceptions of Intelligence, then it was
impossible for knowledge and reasoning to have some
sense-thing as object, as reasoning that has intelligible
principles and conclusion could not result in producing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">699</a></span>
a conception of the sense-(world). Therefore the
foresight which presided over the creation of a living
being or of a whole world could not have been the
result of <span class="locked">reasoning.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span></p>

<h3>BOTH REASONING AND FORESIGHT ARE ONLY
FIGURATIVE EXPRESSIONS.</h3>

<p>There is indeed no reasoning in the divinity. When
we speak of it, in connection with the divinity, it is
only to explain that He has regulated everything as
might have been done by some wise man, who would
have reasoned about results. Attributing foresight to
the divinity indicates merely that He has disposed
everything as might have been done by some wise
man who had foreseen <span class="locked">results.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span> Indeed the only use
of reasoning is to put in order things whose existence
is not anterior to that of reasoning, every time that
that (Intelligence), the power superior to reasoning,
is not strong enough. Likewise, prevision is necessary
in this case, because he who makes use of it does not
possess a power that would enable him to forego or
do without it. Prevision proposes to effect some one
thing instead of another, and seems to fear that that
which it desires might not occur. But, for a (being)
which can do but one thing, both foresight and the
reasoning that decides between contraries, are useless;
for there is no need of reasoning when, of two contrary
courses of action, one only is possible. How would
the Principle which is single, unitary and simple, have
need to reflect that He must do one thing, so that some
other might not take place, or to judge that the second
would occur as alternative to the first? How could
He say that experience has already demonstrated the
utility of some one thing, and that it is well to make
use of it? If the divinity acted thus, then indeed would
He have had recourse to prevision, and consequently,
to reasoning. It is on this hypothesis that we said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">700</a></span>
above that the divinity gave animals senses and faculties;
but it is quite a problem to know what and how
He really gave them.</p>

<h3>IN GOD ALL THINGS WERE SIMULTANEOUS, THOUGH
WHEN REALIZED THEY DEVELOPED.</h3>

<p>Indeed, if it be admitted that in the divinity no
actualization is imperfect, if it be impossible to conceive
in Him anything that is not total or universal,
each one of the things that He contains comprises
within Himself all things. Thus as, to the divinity,
the future is already present, there could not be anything
posterior to Him; but what is already present in
Him becomes posterior in some other (being). Now
if the future be already present in the divinity, it must
be present in Him as if what will happen were already
known; that is, it must be so disposed as to find itself
sufficiently provided for, so as not to stand in need of
anything. Therefore, as all things existed already
within the divinity (when living beings were created),
they had been there from all eternity; and that in a
manner such that it would later be possible to say,
"this occurred after that." Indeed, when the things
that are in the divinity later develop and reveal themselves,
then one sees that the one is after the other;
but, so far as they exist all together, they constitute the
universal (Being), that is, the principle which includes
its own cause.</p>

<h3>IN THE INTELLIGIBLE, EVERYTHING POSSESSES ITS
REASON AS WELL AS ITS FORM.</h3>

<p>2. (By this process) we also know the nature of
Intelligence, which we see still better than the other
things, though we cannot grasp its magnitude. We
admit, in fact, that it possesses the whatness (essence<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>),
of everything, but not its "whyness" (its
cause); or, if we grant (that this "cause" be in Intelligence),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">701</a></span>
we do not think that it is separated (from
its "whatness" (or, <span class="locked">essence<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></span>). Let us suppose that, for
instance, the man, or, if possible, the eye, should offer
itself to our contemplation (in the intelligible world)
as a statue, or as a part of it, would do. The man that
we see on high is both <span class="locked">essence<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span> and cause. As well
as the eye, he must be intellectual, and contain his
cause. Otherwise, he could not exist in the intelligible
world. Here below, just as each part is separated from
the others, so is the cause separated (from the essence).
On high, on the contrary, all things exist in
unity, and each thing is identical with its cause. This
identity may often be noticed even here below, as for
instance, in <span class="locked">eclipses.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span> It would therefore seem probable
that in the intelligible world everything would,
besides the rest, possess its cause, and that its cause
constitutes its essence. This must be admitted; and
that is the reason why those who apply themselves to
grasp the <span class="locked">characteristic<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span> of each being succeed (in
also grasping its cause). Indeed that which each
(being) is, depends on the "cause of such a <span class="locked">form."<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span>
To repeat: not only is a (being's) form its cause,
(which is incontestable), but yet, if one analyses each
form considered in itself, its cause will be found. The
only things which do not contain their causes are those
whose life is without reality, and whose existence is
shadowy.</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE CONTAINS THE CAUSE OF ALL
ITS FORMS.</h3>

<p>What is the origin of the cause of what is a form,
which is characteristic of Intelligence? It is not from
Intelligence, because the form is not separable from
Intelligence, combining with it to form one single and
same thing. If then Intelligence possess the forms in
their fulness, this fulness of forms implies that they
contain their cause. Intelligence contains the cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">702</a></span>
of each of the forms it contains. It consists of all these
forms taken together, or separately. None of them
needs discovery of the cause of its production, for
simultaneously with its production, it has contained the
cause of its hypostatic existence. As it was not produced
by chance, it contains all that belongs to its
cause; consequently, it also possesses the whole perfection
of its cause. Sense-things which participate in
form do not only receive their nature from it, but also
the cause of this nature. If all the things of which
this universe is composed be intimately concatenated;
and if the universe, containing all things, also contain
the cause of each of them; if its relation with them be
the same as that of the body with its organs, which do
not mature successively, but which, towards each other,
are mutually related as cause and effect; so much the
more, in the intelligible world, must things have their
"causes," all of them in general in respect to the
totality, and each independently in respect to itself.</p>

<h3>IN THE INTELLIGIBLE WORLD EACH BEING IS
ACCOMPANIED BY ITS WHYNESS.</h3>

<p>Since all intelligible (entities) have a hypostatic
consubstantial existence affording no room for chance;
and as they are not separated from each other, things
that are caused must bear these their causes within
themselves, and each of them has some sort of a cause,
though without really possessing one. If there be no
cause for the existence of the intelligibles; and if,
though isolated from all causes, they be self-sufficient;
it can only be because they carry their cause along
with them, when they are considered in themselves.
As they contain nothing fortuitous, and as each of
them is manifold, and as its cause is all that they contain,
we might assign this cause to themselves. Thus
in the intelligible world "being" is preceded, or rather
accompanied by its cause, which is still more "being"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">703</a></span>
than cause, or rather which becomes identified with it.
What superfluousness, indeed, could there be in intelligence,
unless its conceptions resemble imperfect productions?
If its conceptions be perfect, one could
neither discover what they lack, nor define their cause,
and, since they possess everything, they also possess
their cause. There, "being" and cause are united; the
presence of both is recognized in each conception, in
each actualization of intelligence. Let us, for instance,
consider the intelligible Man; he seems complete, in his
totality; all his attributes were his simultaneously from
the beginning; he was always entirely complete. It
is the characteristic of that which is generated not
always to be what it ought to be, and to need to acquire
something. The intelligible Man is eternal; he is therefore
always complete; but that which becomes man
must be generated (being).</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE DID NOT DELIBERATE BEFORE
MAKING SENSE-MAN.</h3>

<p>3. But why could Intelligence not have deliberated
before producing the sense-man? The (man we know
by our senses) was (created) by similitude to the (intelligible
Man), nothing can be added to him, nothing
subtracted. It is a mere supposition to say that Intelligence
deliberates and reasons. The theory that things
were created, implies preliminary deliberation and
reasoning; but (the latter becomes impossible) in the
case of eternal generation, for that which originates
<span class="locked">eternally,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span> cannot be the object of a deliberation.
Intelligence could not deliberate without having forgotten
the course it had followed before; it cannot
improve later on without implying that its beginnings
were not perfectly beautiful; had they been this, they
would have remained so. If things be beautiful, it is
that they represent their cause well; for even here
below an object is beautiful only if it possess all its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">704</a></span>
legitimate possessions; that is, if it possess its proper
form. It is the form that contains everything; the form
contains the matter, in the sense that it fashions matter,
and leaves nothing formless therein. But it would
contain something formless if a man lacked some part,
as, for instance, an organ such as the eye.</p>

<h3>BEING CONTAINS ITS CAUSE.</h3>

<p>Thus, a thing is fully explained by the clearing up
of its cause. Why should there be eyebrows above the
eye? That it may possess all that is implied in its
being. Were these parts of the body given to man
to protect him from dangers? That would be to
establish within being a principle charged to watch over
being. The things of which we speak are implied in
the being that existed before them. Consequently,
being contains within itself the cause which, if distinct
from being, is nevertheless inseparable therefrom. All
things are implied in each <span class="locked">other<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></span>; taken together,
they form the total, perfect and universal Being; their
perfection is bound up with, and is inherent in their
cause; thus a (creature's) "being," its "characteristic"
(to ti ên einai), and its "cause" (why-ness) fall together.
(Before asking an important question we must
premiss that) in the intelligible world the cause that is
complementary to a being is ultimately united to it.
We must also premiss that, by virtue of its perfection,
divine Intelligence contains the causes (as well as the
<span class="locked">beings<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span>), so that it is only "a posteriori" that we observe
that things are well regulated. If then the possession
of senses, and indeed of particular ones, be
implied in the form of man by the eternal necessity
and perfection of divine Intelligence, then the intelligible
Man was by no means mere intelligence, receiving
the senses when descending into generation.
(If then having senses be implied in the form of man),
does not Intelligence incline towards the things here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">705</a></span>
below? In what do these senses (which are attributed
to the intelligible Man) consist? Are these senses
the potentiality of perceiving sense-objects? But it
would be absurd that, on high, man should from all
eternity possess the potentiality of feeling, yet feel only
here below, and that this potentiality should pass to
actualization only when the soul became less good
(by its union to the body).</p>

<h3>SUCH QUESTIONS DEMAND SCRUTINY OF THE
INTELLIGIBLE MAN.</h3>

<p>4. To answer these questions, we would have to
go back to the nature of the intelligible Man. Before
defining the latter, however, it would indeed be far
better to begin by determining the nature of the sense-man,
on the supposition that we know the latter very
well, while perhaps of the former, we have only a
very inexact notion.</p>

<h3>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MAN KNOWN BY THE
SENSES AND THE INTELLIGIBLE MAN.</h3>

<p>But there are some (Aristotelians or Peripatetics)
who might think that the intelligible Man and the
sense-man form but one. Let us first discuss this
point. Does the sense-man have a being different from
the soul which produces him, and makes him live and
reason? Is he the soul that is disposed in some special
manner? Is he the soul that uses the body in some
particular way? If man be a reasonable living organism,
and if the latter be composed of soul and body,
this definition of man will not be identical with that of
the soul. If the man be defined as being the composite
of the reasonable soul and the body, how can he be
an immortal hypostatic existence? This definition
suits the sense-man only from the moment that the
union of the soul and the body has occurred; it expresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">706</a></span>
what will be, instead of setting forth what we
call the Man-in-himself; rather than being a real determination
of his characteristics, it would be only a
description which would not reveal the original being.
Instead of defining form engaged in matter, it indicates
what is the composite of soul and body, after the union
has occurred. In this case, we do not yet know what
is man considered in his being, which is intelligible.
To the claim that the definition of sense-things should
express something composite, it might be answered,
that we do acknowledge that we must not determine
the consistence of each thing. Now if it be absolutely
necessary to define the forms engaged in matter, we
must also define the being that constitutes the man;
that is necessary especially for those (Peripateticians)
who, by a definition, mean a statement of a being's
original "characteristics."</p>

<h3>MAN DEFINED AS A REASONABLE SOUL.</h3>

<p>What then is the "being" of man? This really
is asking for the "man-ness" of a man, something
characteristic of him, and inseparable from him. Is
the genuine definition of a man that "he is a reasonable
animal"? Would not this rather be the definition
of the composite man? What is the being that produces
the reasonable animal? In the above definition
of man, "reasonable animal" means "reasonable life";
consequently, man may be called the "reasonable life."
But can life exist without a soul? (No), for the soul
will give the man reasonable life; and in this case,
instead of being a substance, man will be only an
actualization of the soul; or even, the man will be the
soul herself. But if man be the reasonable soul, what
objection will there be to his remaining man even when
his soul should happen to pass into a different body
(as that of a brute animal)?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">707</a></span></p>

<h3>MAN AS A SOUL SUBSISTING IN A SPECIAL REASON.</h3>

<p>5. Man must therefore have as "reason" (or, as
essence), something else than the soul. Still, in this
case, man might be something composite; that is, the
soul would subsist in a particular "reason," admitting
that this "reason" was a certain actualization of the
soul, though this actualization could not exist without
its producing principle. Now such is the nature of the
"seminal reasons." They do not exist without the
soul; for the generating reasons are not inanimate;
and nevertheless they are not the soul purely and
simply. There is therefore nothing surprising in the
statement that these (human) beings are ("seminal)
reasons."</p>

<h3>THESE REASONS ARE THE ACTUALIZATIONS OF
THE SOUL WHICH BEGETS THE ANIMAL.</h3>

<p>Of which soul are these <span class="locked">reasons,<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span> which do not
beget the man (though they do beget the animal),
then the actualization? Not of the vegetative soul;
they are the actualizations of the (reasonable) soul
which begets the <span class="locked">animal,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span> which is a more powerful,
and therefore a more living soul. Man is <span class="locked">constituted<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span>
by the soul disposed in some manner, when present to
matter disposed in some particular fashion&mdash;since the
soul is some particular thing, according as she is in
some particular disposition&mdash;even in the body. In the
bodies, she fashions a resembling form. So far as the
nature of the body allows it, she thus produces an
image of the man, as the painter himself makes an
image of the body; she produces, I repeat, an inferior
man (the sense-man, the animal), which possesses the
form of man, his reasons, morals, dispositions, faculties,
although in an imperfect manner, because he is
not the first man (the intellectual man). He has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">708</a></span>
sensations of another kind; sensations which, though
they seem clear, are obscure, if they be compared to
the superior sensations of which they are the images.
The superior man (the reasonable man) is better, has
a diviner soul, and clearer sensations. It is he doubtless
to whom Plato refers (when he says, Man is the
<span class="locked">soul<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span>); in his definition he adds, "which makes use
of the body," because the diviner man dominates the
soul which uses the body, and thus uses the body only
in an indirect <span class="locked">manner.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span></p>

<h3>NATURE OF THE COMBINATION BEGOTTEN BY
THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>In fact, the soul attaches herself to the thing begotten
by the soul, because she was capable of feeling.
The soul does this by vivifying it more; or rather, the
soul does not attach herself thereto, but draws it to
herself. She does not depart from the intelligible
world, but even while remaining in contact with it,
she holds the inferior soul (which constitutes the sense-man)
suspended to herself; and by her reason she
blends herself with this reason (or, she unites herself
to this being by her "being"). That is why this man
(known by the senses), who by himself is obscure, is
enlightened by this illumination.</p>

<h3>THE THREE MEN IN EACH OF US.</h3>

<p>6. What is the relation of the sense-power within
the superior Soul (or, in the rational soul)? Intelligible
sensation perceives (intelligible) objects that,
speaking strictly, are not sensible, and corresponds to
the (intelligible) manner in which they are perceivable.
Thus (by this intelligible sense-power) the Soul
perceives the supersensual harmony and also the
sensual, but in a manner such as the sense-man perceives
it, relating it so far as possible to the superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">709</a></span>
<span class="locked">harmony,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span> just as he relates the earthly fire to the
intelligible Fire, which is above, and which the superior
Soul felt in a manner suitable to the nature of this fire.
If the bodies which are here below were up there also,
the superior Soul would feel them and perceive them.
The man who exists on high is a Soul disposed in some
particular manner, capable of perceiving these objects;
hence the man of the last degree (the sense-man)
being the image of the intelligible Man, has reasons
(faculties) which are also images (faculties possessed
by the superior Man). The man who exists in the
divine Intelligence constitutes the Man superior to all
men. He illuminates the second (the reasonable man),
who in his turn illuminates the third (the sense-man).
The man of this last degree somewhat possesses the
two others; he is not produced by them, he is rather
united to them. The man who constitutes us actualizes
himself as the man of the last degree. The third
receives something of the second; and the second is
the actualization of the <span class="locked">first.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span> Each man's nature
depends on the "man" according to whom he acts
(the man is intellectual, reasonable, or sensual according
as he exercises intelligence, discursive reason, or
sensibility). Each one of us possesses the three men
in one sense (potentially); and does not possess them
in another (in actualization; that is, he does not simultaneously
exercise intellect, reason, or sense).</p>

<h3>FATE OF THESE THREE MEN, IN BRUTALIZATION
AND IN DIVINIZATION.</h3>

<p>When the third life (the sense-power) which constitutes
the third man, is separated from the body, if
the life that precedes it (the discursive reason) accompany
it without nevertheless being separated from the
intelligible world, then one may say that the second
is everywhere the third is. It might seem surprising
that the latter, when passing into the body of a brute,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">710</a></span>
should drag along that part which is the being of man.
This being was all beings (potentially); only, at different
times, it acts through different faculties. So
far as it is pure, and is not yet depraved, it wishes to
constitute a man, and it is indeed a man that it constitutes;
for to form a man is better (than to form a
brute), and it does what is best. It also forms guardians
of the superior order, but such as are still conformable
to the being constituent of manhood. The
(intellectual) Man, who is anterior to this being, is
of a nature still more like that of the guardians, or
rather, he is already a divinity. The guardian attached
to a divinity is an image of him, as the sense-man is
the image of the intellectual man from whom he depends;
for the principle to which man directly attaches
himself must not be considered as his divinity. There
is a difference here, similar to that existing between
the souls, though they all belong to the same <span class="locked">order.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span>
Besides, those guardians whom Plato simply calls
"guardians" (demons), should be called guardian-like,
or "demonic" <span class="locked">beings.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span> Last, when the superior Soul
accompanies the inferior soul which has chosen the
condition of a brute, the inferior soul which was bound
to the superior soul&mdash;even when she constituted a man&mdash;develops
the ("seminal) reason" of the animal
(whose condition she has chosen); for she possesses
that "reason" in herself; it is her inferior actualization.</p>

<h3>ANIMAL SEMINAL REASONS MAY BE CONTRARY TO
SOUL'S NATURE; THOUGH NOT TO THE SOUL
HERSELF.</h3>

<p>7. It may however be objected that if the soul produce
the nature of a brute only when she is depraved
and degraded, she was not originally destined to produce
an ox or a horse; then the ("seminal) reason"
of the horse, as well as the horse itself, will be contrary
to the nature (of the soul). No: they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">711</a></span>
inferior to her nature, but they are not contrary
to her. From her very origin, the soul was (potentially)
the ("seminal) reason" of a horse or a
dog. When permitted, the soul which was to beget
an animal, produces something better; when hindered,
she (only) produces what accords with the circumstances.
She resembles the artists who, knowing how
to produce several figures, create either the one they
have received the order to create, or the one that is
most suited to the material at hand. What hinders the
(natural and generative) power of the universal Soul,
in her quality of universal ("seminal) Reason," from
sketching out the outlines of the body, before the soul
powers (or, individual souls) should descend from her
into matter? What hinders this sketch from being a
kind of preliminary illumination of matter? What
would hinder the individual soul from finishing (fashioning
the body sketched by the universal Soul), following
the lines already traced, and organizing the
members pictured by them, and becoming that which
she approached by giving herself some particular
figure, just as, in a choric ballet, the dancer confines
himself to the part assigned to him?</p>

<h3>THE SENSE-WORLD AND THE INTELLIGIBLE WORLD
ARE CONNECTED BY THE MANIFOLD TRIPLE
NATURE OF MAN.</h3>

<p>Such considerations have been arrived at merely as
result of scrutiny of the consequences of the principles
laid down. Our purpose was to discover how sensibility
occurs in the man himself, without intelligible
things falling into generation. We recognized and
demonstrated that intelligible things do not incline
towards sense-things, but that, on the contrary, it is
the latter that aspire and rise to the former, and imitate
them; that the sense-man derives from the intellectual
man the power of contemplating intelligible entities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">712</a></span>
though the sense-man remain united to sense-things,
as the intellectual man remains united to the intelligible
entities. Indeed, intelligible things are in some respects
sensual; and we may call them such because (ideally)
they are Bodies, but they are perceived in a manner
different from bodies. Likewise, our sensations are
less clear than the perception which occurs in the
intelligible world, and that we also call Sensation, because
it refers to Bodies (which exist on high only in
an ideal manner). Consequently, we call the man
here below sensual because he perceives less well
things which themselves are less good; that is, which
are only images of intelligible things. We might therefore
say that sensations here below are obscure
thoughts, and that the Thoughts on high are distinct
Sensations. Such are our views about sensibility.</p>

<h3>INTELLIGIBLE ANIMALS DO NOT INCLINE TOWARDS
THE SENSE-WORLD FOR THEY ARE PRE-EXISTING,
AND ARE DISTINCT FROM THEIR CREATING
IMAGE.</h3>

<p>8. (Now let us pass to the other question we
asked). How does it happen that all the Animals who,
like the Horse itself, are contained in divine Intelligence,
do not incline towards the things here below
(by generating them)? Doubtless, to beget a horse,
or any other animal here below, divine Intelligence
must hold its conception; nevertheless it must not
be believed that it first had the volition of producing
the horse, and only later its conception. Evidently,
it could not have wished to produce the horse, but
because it already had the conception thereof; and it
could not have had the conception thereof but because
it had to produce the horse. Consequently, the Horse
who was not begotten preceded the horse who later was
to be begotten. Since the first Horse has been anterior
to all generation, and was not conceived to be begotten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">713</a></span>
it is not because the divine Intelligence inclines
towards the things here below, nor because it produces
them, that it contains the intelligible Horse and the
other beings. The intelligible entities existed already
in Intelligence (before it begat) and the sense-things
were later begotten by necessary consequence; for it
was impossible that the procession should cease with
the intelligibles. Who indeed could have stopped this
power of the (Intelligence) which is capable of simultaneous
procession, and of remaining within itself?</p>

<h3>IRRATIONAL ANIMALS MUST EXIST WITHIN INTELLIGENCE,
UNLESS MAN ALONE WAS TO EXIST.</h3>

<p>But why should these Animals (devoid of reason)
exist in the divine Intelligence? We might understand
that animals endowed with reason might be found
within it; but does this multitude of irrational animals
seem at all admirable? Does it not rather seem something
unworthy of the divine Intelligence? Evidently
the essence which is one must be also manifold, since
it is posterior to the Unity which is absolutely simple;
otherwise, instead of being inferior to it, it would fuse
with it. Being posterior to that Unity, it could not be
more simple, and must therefore be less so. Now as
the unity was the One who is excellent, essence had
to be less unitary, since multiplicity is the characteristic
of inferiority. But why should essence not be merely
the "pair" (instead of the manifold)? Neither of the
elements of the Pair could any longer be absolutely
one, and each would itself become a further pair;
and we might point out the same thing of each of the
new elements (in which each element of the primary
Pair would have split up). Besides, the first Pair contains
both movement and stability; it is also intelligence
and perfect life. The character of Intelligence is not to
be one, but to be universal; it therefore contains all the
particular intelligences; it is all the intelligences, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">714</a></span>
at the same time it is something greater than all. It
possesses life not as a single soul, but as a universal
Soul, having the superior power of producing individual
souls. It is besides the universal living Organism
(or, Animal); consequently, it should not contain
man alone (but also all the other kinds of animals);
otherwise, man alone would exist upon the earth.</p>

<h3>MANY ANIMALS ARE NOT SO IRRATIONAL AS
DIFFERENT.</h3>

<p>9. It may be objected that Intelligence might
(well) contain the ideas of animals of a higher order.
But how can it contain the ideas of animals that are
vile, or entirely without reason? For we should consider
vile every animal devoid of reason and intelligence,
since it is to these faculties that those who possess
them owe their nobility. It is doubtless difficult to
understand how things devoid of reason and intelligence
can exist in the divine Intelligence, in which are all
beings, and from which they all proceed. But before beginning
the discussion of this question, let us assume
the following verities as granted: Man here below is not
what is man in the divine Intelligence, any more than
the other animals. Like them, in a higher form, he
dwells within (the divine Intelligence); besides, no
being called reasonable may be found within it, for it
is only here below that reason is employed; on high
the only acts are those superior to discursive <span class="locked">reason.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span></p>

<p>Why then is man here below the only animal who
makes use of reason? Because the intelligence of Man,
in the intelligible world, is different from that of other
animals, and so his reason here below must differ from
their reason; for it can be seen that many actions
of other animals imply the use of judgment.</p>

<p>(In reply, it might be asked) why are not all
animals equally rational? And why are not all men
also equally rational? Let us reflect: all these lives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">715</a></span>
which represent as many movements; all these intelligences,
which form a plurality; could not be identical.
Therefore they had to differ among each other, and
their difference had to consist in manifesting more or
less clearly life and intelligence; those that occupy the
first rank are distinguished by primary differences;
those that occupy the second rank, by secondary differences;
and so forth. Thus, amidst intelligences, some
constitute the divinities, others the beings placed in the
second rank, and gifted with reason; further, other beings
that we here call deprived of reason and intelligence
really were reason and intelligence in the intelligible
world. Indeed, he who thinks the intelligible
Horse, for instance, is Intelligence, just as is the very
thought of the horse. If nothing but thought existed,
there would be nothing absurd in that this thought,
while being intellectual, might, as object, have a being
devoid of intelligence. But since thought and the object
thought fuse, how could thought be intellectual
unless the object thought were so likewise? To effect
this, Intelligence would, so to speak, have to render
itself unintelligent. But it is not so. The thing
thought is a determinate intelligence, just as it is a
determinate life. Now, just as no life, whatever it be,
can be deprived of vitality, so no determinate intelligence
can be deprived of intellectuality. The very intelligence
which is proper to an animal, such as, for instance,
man, does not cease being intelligence of all
things; whichever of its parts you choose to consider, it
is all things, only in a different manner; while it is
a single thing in actualization, it is all things in potentiality.
However, in any one particular thing, we
grasp only what it is in actualization. Now what is in
actualization (that is, a particular thing), occupies the
last rank. Such, in Intelligence, for instance, is the
idea of the Horse. In its procession, Intelligence continues
towards a less perfect life, and at a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">716</a></span>
degree constitutes a horse, and at some inferior degree,
constitutes some animal still inferior; for the greater
the development of the powers of Intelligence, the
more imperfect these become. At each degree in their
procession they lose something; and as it is a lower
degree of essence that constitutes some particular
animal, its inferiority is redeemed by something new.
Thus, in the measure that life is less complete in the
animal, appear nails, claws, or horns, or teeth. Everywhere
that Intelligence diminishes on one side, it rises
on another side by the fulness of its nature, and it finds
in itself the resources by which to compensate for
whatever it may lack.</p>

<h3>APPARENT IMPERFECTIONS ARE ONLY LOWER
FORMS OF PERFECTION.</h3>

<p>10. But how can there be anything imperfect in
the intelligible world? Why does the intelligible
Animal have horns? Is it for its <span class="locked">defense?<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span> To be
perfect and complete. It is to be perfect as an animal,
perfect as intelligence, and perfect as life; so that, if
it lack one quality, it may have a substitute. The
cause of the differences, is that what belongs to one
being finds itself replaced in another being by something
else; so that the totality (of the beings) may
result in the most perfect Life, and Intelligence, while
all the particular beings which are thus found in the
intelligible essence are perfect so far as they are particular.</p>

<h3>CO-EXISTENCE OF UNITY AND MULTIPLICITY
DEMANDS ORGANIZATION IN SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>The essence must be simultaneously one and manifold.
Now it cannot be manifold if all the things that
exist within it be equal; it would then be an absolute
unity. Since therefore (essence) forms a composite
unity, it must be constituted by things which bear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">717</a></span>
each other specific differences, such that its unity shall
allow the existence of particular things, such as forms
and reasons (beings). The forms, such as those of
man, must contain all the differences that are essential
to them. Though there be a unity in all these forms,
there are also things more or less delicate (or highly
organized), such as the eye or the finger. All these
organs, however, are implied in the unity of the animal,
and they are inferior only relatively to the totality. It
was better that things should be such. Reason (the
essence of the animal) is animal, and besides, is something
different from the animal. Virtue also bears a
general character, and an individual one. The totality
(of the intelligible world) is beautiful, because what
is common (to all beings), does not offer any differences.</p>

<h3>BUT HOW COULD THE INTELLIGIBLE WORLD
CONTAIN VEGETABLES OR METALS?</h3>

<p>11. (The Timaeus of <span class="locked">Plato<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span>) states that heaven
has not scorned to receive any of the forms of the
animals, of which we see so great a number. The
cause must be that this universe was to contain the
universality of things. Whence does it derive all the
things it contains? From on high? Yes, it received
from above all the things that were produced by reason,
according to an intelligible form. But, just as it contains
fire and water, it must also contain plant-life.
Now, how could there be plant-life in the intelligible
world? Are earth and fire living entities within it?
For they must be either living or dead entities; in the
latter case, not everything would be alive in the intelligible
world. In what state then do the above-mentioned
objects find themselves on high (in the
intelligible world)?</p>

<p>First it can be demonstrated that plants contain
nothing opposed to reason; since, even here below, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">718</a></span>
plant contains a "reason" which constitutes its <span class="locked">life.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span>
But if the essential "reason" of the plant, which constitutes
it, is a life of a particular kind, and a kind of
soul, and if this "reason" itself be a unity, is it the
primary Plant? No: the primary Plant, from which
the particular plant is derived, is above that "reason."
The primary Plant is unity; the other is multiple, and
necessarily derives from this unity. If so, the primary
Plant must possess life in a still higher degree, and be
the Plant itself from which the plants here below proceed,
which occupy the second or third rank, and which
derive from the primary Plant the traces of the life
they reveal.</p>

<h3>HOW THE EARTH EXISTS IN THE INTELLIGIBLE.</h3>

<p>But how does the earth exist in the intelligible
world? What is its essence? How can the earth in
the intelligible world be alive there? Let us first examine
our earth, that is, inquire what is its essence?
It must be some sort of a shape, and a reason; for the
reason of the plant is alive, even here below. Is there
then a living ("seminal) reason" in the earth also?
To discover the nature of the earth, let us take essentially
terrestrial objects, which are begotten or
fashioned by it. The birth of the stones, and their
increase, the interior formation of mountains, could
not exist unless an animated reason produced them
by an intimate and secret work. This reason is the
"form of the <span class="locked">earth,"<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span> a form that is analogous to what
is called nature in trees. The earth might be compared
to the trunk of a tree, and the stone that can be
detached therefrom to the branch that can be separated
from the trunk. Consideration of the stone which is
not yet dug out of the earth, and which is united to
it as the uncut branch is united to the tree, shows that
the earth's nature, which is a productive force, constitutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">719</a></span>
a life endowed with reason; and it must be
evident that the intelligible earth must possess life at
a still higher degree, that the rational life of the earth
is the Earth-in-itself, the primary Earth, from which
proceeds the earth here below.</p>

<h3>THE FIRE AS IT IS IN THE INTELLIGIBLE WORLD.</h3>

<p>If fire also be a reason engaged in matter, and in this
respect resemble the earth, it was not born by chance.
Whence would it come?<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> Lucretius thought it came
from rubbing (sticks or stones). But fire existed in
the universe before one body rubbed another; bodies
already possess fire when they rub up against one
another; for it must not be believed that matter possesses
fire potentially, so that it is capable of producing
it spontaneously. But what is fire, since the principle
which produces the fire, giving it a form, must
be a "reason"? It is a soul capable of producing the
fire, that is, a "reason" and a life, which (fuse) into
one thing. That is why Plato says that in every object
there is a <span class="locked">soul<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span>; that is, a power capable of producing
the sense-fire. Thus the principle which produces the
fire in our world is a "fiery life," a fire that is more
real than ours. Since then the intelligible Fire is a fire
more real than ours, it also possesses a moral life.
The Fire-in-itself therefore possesses life. There is a
similar "reason" in the other elements, air and water.
Why should not these things be as animated as earth
is? They are evidently contained in the universal
living Organism, and they constitute parts thereof.
Doubtless life is not manifest in them, any more than
in the earth; but it can be recognized in them, as it is
recognized in the earth, by its productions; for living
beings are born in the fire, and still more in the water,
as is better known; others also are formed in the air.
The flames that we daily see lit and extinguished do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">720</a></span>
not manifest in the universal Soul (because of the
shortness of their duration); her presence is not revealed
in the fire, because she does not here below
succeed in reaching a mass of sufficient permanency.</p>

<h3>WATER AND AIR AS INTELLIGIBLE ENTITIES.</h3>

<p>It is not otherwise with water and air. If by their
nature these elements were more consistent, they would
reveal the universal Soul; but as their essence is dispersed,
they do not reveal the power that animates
them. In a similar case are the fluids occurring in our
body, as, for instance, the blood; the flesh, which seems
animated, is formed at the expense of the <span class="locked">blood.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span>
The latter must therefore enjoy the presence of the
soul, though it seem deprived of the (soul) because
(the blood) manifests no sensibility, opposes no resistance,
and by its fluidity easily separates itself from the
soul that vivifies it, as happens to the three elements
already mentioned. Likewise the animals which Nature
forms out of condensed air feel without <span class="locked">suffering.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span>
As fixed and permanent light penetrates the air so long
as the air itself is permanent, the soul also penetrates
the atmosphere surrounding her without being absorbed
by it. Other elements are in the same case.</p>

<h3>THE INTELLIGIBLE WORLD IS A COMPLETE MODEL
OF THIS OUR UNIVERSE.</h3>

<p>12. We therefore repeat that since we admit that
our universe is modeled on the intelligible World, we
should so much the more recognize that the latter is
the universal living Organism, which constitutes all
things because it consists of perfect essence. Consequently
in the intelligible world, the heavens also are
an animated being, not even lacking what here below
are called the stars; indeed the latter are what constitutes
the heavens' essence. Neither is the Earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721">721</a></span>
on high something dead; for it is alive, containing all
the Animals that walk on the ground, and that are
named terrestrial, as well as Vegetation whose foundation
is life. On high exist also the Sea and the Water
in universal condition, in permanent fluidity and animation,
containing all the Animals that dwell in the water.
Air also forms part of the intelligible world, with the
Animals that inhabit the air, and which on high possess
a nature in harmony with it. How indeed could
the things contained in a living being not also themselves
be living beings? Consequently they are also
such here below. Why indeed should not all the
animals necessarily exist in the intelligible World?
The nature of the great parts of this world indeed
necessarily determines the nature of the animals that
these parts contain. Thus from the "having" and
"being" (existence and nature) of the intelligible
world is derived that of all the beings contained therein.
These things imply each other. To ask the reason for
the existence of the Animals contained in the intelligible
world, is to ask why exists this very world itself, or
the universal living Organism, or, what amounts to
the same thing, why exist the universal Life, the universal
Soul, in which are found no fault, no imperfection,
and from which everywhere overflows the
fulness of life.</p>

<h3>ALL THINGS UNITED BY A COMMON SOURCE.</h3>

<p>All these things derive from one and the same
source; it is neither a breath nor a single heat; but
rather a single quality, which contains and preserves
within itself all the qualities, the sweetness of the most
fragrant perfumes, the flavor of the wine, and of the
finest tasty juices, the gleam of the most flashing
colors, the softness of the objects which flatter touch
with the greatest delicacy, the rhythm and harmony of
all the kinds of sounds which can charm the hearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">722</a></span></p>

<h3>SIMPLICITY OF THE INTELLIGIBLE DOES NOT DENY
COMPOSITENESS, BUT INFERS HEIGHT OF SOURCE.</h3>

<p>13. Neither Intelligence, nor the Soul that proceeds
therefrom, are simple; both contain the universality of
things with their infinite variety, so far as these are
simple, meaning that they are not composite, but that
they are principles and actualizations; for, in the intelligible
world, the actualization of what occupies the
last rank is simple; the actualization of what occupies
the first rank is universal. Intelligence, in its uniform
movement, always trends towards similar and identical
things; nevertheless, each of them is identical and
single, without being a part; it is on the contrary universal,
because what, in the intelligible world, is a part,
is not a simple unit, but a unity that is infinitely divisible.
In this movement, Intelligence starts from one
object, and goes to another object which is its goal.
But does all that is intermediary resemble a straight
line, or to a uniform and homogeneous body? There
would be nothing remarkable about that; for if Intelligence
did not contain differences, if no diversity
awoke it to life, it would not be an actualization; its
state would not differ from inactivity. If its movement
were determined in a single manner, it would
possess but a single kind of (restricted) life, instead
of possessing the universal Life. Now it should contain
an universal and omnipresent Life; consequently,
it must move, or rather have been moved towards all
(beings). If it were to move in a simple and uniform
manner, it would possess but a single thing, would be
identical with it, and no longer proceed towards anything
different. If however it should move towards
something different, it would have to become something
different, and be two things. If these two things
were then to be identical, Intelligence would still remain
one, and there would be no progress left;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">723</a></span>
if, on the contrary, these two things were to be different,
it would be proceeding with this difference,
and it would, by virtue of this difference joined to its
divinity, beget some third thing. By its origin, the
latter is simultaneously identical and different; not
of some particular difference, but of all kinds of difference,
because the identity it contains is itself universal.
Thus being universal difference as well as
universal identity, this thing possesses all that is said
to be different; for its nature is to be universal differentiation
(to spread over everything, to become everything
else). If all these differences preceded this (Intelligence),
the latter would be modified by them. If
this be not the case, Intelligence must have begotten all
the differences, or rather, be their universality.</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE EVOLVES OVER THE FIELD OF
TRUTH.</h3>

<p>Essences ("beings") therefore cannot exist without
an actualization of Intelligence. By this actualization,
after having produced some ("being"), Intelligence
always produces some other one, somehow carrying
out the career which it is natural for veritable Intelligence
to carry out within itself; this career is that of
the beings, of which each corresponds to one of its
evolutions, (or, it roams around among beings, so that
through its roaming around these beings unite and
form.) Since Intelligence is everywhere identical, its
evolutions imply permanence, and they make it move
around the "field of <span class="locked">truth"<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span> without ever issuing
therefrom. It occupies this whole field, because Intelligence
has made itself the locality where its evolutions
operate, a locality which is identical with what it
contains. This field is varied enough to offer a career
to be fulfilled; if it were not universally and eternally
varied, there would be a stopping-place where variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">724</a></span>
would cease; and, were Intelligence to stop, it would
not think; and if it had never stopped, it would have
existed without thought (or, it would not exist). This
however, is not the case; therefore thought exists, and
its universal movement produces the fulness of universal
"Being." Universal "Being," however, is the
thought that embraces universal Life, and which, after
each thing, ever conceives some other; because, since
that which within it is identical is all so different. It
continually divides and ever finds something different
from the others. In its march, Intelligence ever
progresses from life to life, from animated (beings)
to animated (beings); just as some traveller, advancing
on the earth, finds all that he travels through to be
earth, whatever variations thereof there may have
been. In the intelligible world, the life whose field
one traverses is always self-identical, but it is also
always different. The result is that (this sphere of
operations) does not seem the same to us, because in
its evolution, which is identical, life experiences (or,
traverses) things which are not the same. That however
does not change this life, for it passes through
different things in a uniform and identical manner. If
this uniformity and identity of Intelligence were not
applied to different things, Intelligence would remain
idle; it would no longer exist in actualization, and no
more be actualization. Now these different things constitute
Intelligence itself. Intelligence is therefore universal,
because this universality forms its very nature.
Being thus universal, Intelligence is all things; there
is nothing in it which does not contribute to its universality;
and everything is different, so as to be able
still to contribute to totality, by its very difference.
If there were no difference, if everything in it were
identical, the being of Intelligence would be diminished,
inasmuch as its nature would no more co-operate towards
its harmonic consummation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">725</a></span></p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE CONTAINS THE INFINITE AS
SIMULTANEOUSNESS OF ONE AND MANY
AND AS FRIENDSHIP.</h3>

<p>14. By intellectual examples we can understand
the nature of Intelligence, and see that it could not be
a unity which does not admit any kind of difference.
As example, consider the ("seminal) reason" of a
plant, and that of an animal. If it be only a unity,
without any kind of variety, it is not even a "reason,"
and what is born will be no more than matter. This
"reason" must therefore contain all the organs; and,
while embracing all matter, it must not leave any part
of it to remain identical with any other. For instance,
the face does not form a single mass; it contains the
nose and the eyes. Nor is even the nose something
simple; it contains different parts whose variety make
of it an organ; if it were reduced to a state of absolute
simplicity, it would be no more than a mass. Thus
Intelligence contains the infinite, because it is simultaneously
one and manifold; not indeed like a house,
but as is a ("seminal) reason" which is manifold interiorly.
It contains within, therefore, a sort of figure
(or scheme) or even a picture, on which are interiorly
drawn or inscribed its powers and thoughts; their
division does not take place exteriorly, for it is entirely
interior. Thus the universal living Organism embraces
other living beings, within which may be discovered still
smaller living beings, and still smaller powers, and so
on till we arrive at the "atomic <span class="locked">form."<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span> All these
forms are distinguished from each other by their division,
without ever having been confounded together,
though they all occur in the constitution of a single
unity. Thus exists in the intelligible world that union
(by Empedocles) called "friendship"; but such union
is very different from that which exists in the <span class="locked">sense-world.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></span>
In fact, the latter is only the image of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">726</a></span>
first, because it is formed of completely disparate elements.
Veritable union however consists in forming
but a single (thing) without admitting of any separation
between (elements). Here below, however, objects
are separated from each other.</p>

<h3 class="large">B. A STUDY OF THE GOOD.</h3>

<h3>ALL SOULS ARE UNITED BY THEIR HIGHEST, WITH
INTELLIGENCE SHINING DOWN FROM THE PEAK
THEY FORM.</h3>

<p>15. Who then will be able to contemplate this multiple
and universal Life, primary and one, without being
charmed therewith, and without scorning every other
kind of life? For our lives here below, that are so
weak, impotent, incomplete, whose impurity soils other
lives, can be considered as nothing but tenebrous. As
soon as you consider these lives, you no longer see the
others, you no longer live with these other lives in
which everything is living; which are relieved of all
impurity, and of all contact with evil. Indeed, evil
reigns here below <span class="locked">only<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></span>; here where we have but a
trace of Intelligence and of the intelligible life. On
the contrary, in the intelligible world exists "that
archetype which is beneficent (which possesses the
form of Good"), as says <span class="locked">Plato,<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span> because it possesses
good by the forms (that is, by the ideas). Indeed, the
absolute Good is something different from the Intelligence
which is good only because its life is passed in
contemplating the Good. The objects contemplated
by Intelligence are the essences which have the form
of Good, and which it possesses from the moment it
contemplates the Good. Intelligence receives the
Good, not such as the Good is in itself, but such as
Intelligence is capable of receiving it. The Good is
indeed the supreme principle. From the Good therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">727</a></span>
Intelligence derives its perfection; to the Good
Intelligence owes its begetting of all the intelligible
entities; on the one hand, Intelligence could not consider
the Good without thinking it; on the other, it
must not have seen in the Good the intelligible entities,
otherwise, Intelligence itself could not have begotten
them. Thus Intelligence has, from the Good, received
the power to beget, and to fill itself with that which it
has <span class="locked">begotten.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span> The Good does not Himself possess
the things which He thus donates; for He is absolutely
one, and that which has been given to Intelligence is
manifold. Incapable in its plenitude to embrace, and
in its unity to possess the power it was receiving, Intelligence
split it up, thus rendering it manifold, so as
to possess it at least in fragments. Thus everything
begotten by Intelligence proceeds from the power derived
from the Good, and bears its form; as intelligence
itself is good, and as it is composed of things that bear
the form of Good, it is a varied good. The reader
may be assisted in forming a conception of it by
imagining a variegated living sphere, or a composite
of animated and brilliant faces. Or again, imagine
pure souls, pure and complete (in their essence), all
united by their highest (faculties), and then universal
Intelligence seated on this summit, and illuminating the
whole intelligible region. In this simile, the reader
who imagines it considers it as something outside of
himself; but (to contemplate Intelligence) one has to
become Intelligence, and then give oneself a panorama
of oneself.</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE CONTAINS ALL THINGS THAT ARE
CONFORMED TO THE GOOD.</h3>

<p>16. Instead of stopping at this multiple beauty, it
must be abandoned to rise (to the Good), the supreme
principle. By reasoning not according to the nature
of our world, but according to that of the universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">728</a></span>
Intelligence, we should with astonishment ask ourselves
which is the principle that has begotten it, and
how it did <span class="locked">so.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span> Each one (of the essences contained
in the Intelligence) is a (particular) form, and somehow
has its own type. As their common characteristic
is to be assimilated to the Good, the consequence is
that Intelligence contains all the things conformable
to the Good. It possesses therefore the essence which
is in all things; it contains all the animals, as well as the
universal Life within them, and all the rest.</p>

<h3>THE GOOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF BEING, BUT
ITS INTUITION AS WELL.</h3>

<p>Why must these things be considered as goods, when
considered from this point of view? The solution of
this problem may be arrived at from the following consideration.
When for the first time Intelligence contemplated
the Good, this its contemplation split the
Good's unity into multiplicity. Though itself were a
single being, this its thought divided the unity because
of its inability to grasp it in its entirety. To this it may
be answered that Intelligence was not yet such the first
time it contemplated the Good. Did it then contemplate
the Good without intelligence? Intelligence did
not yet see the Good; but Intelligence dwelt near it,
was dependent on it, and was turned towards <span class="locked">it.<a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span>
Having arrived at its fulness, because it was operating
on high, and was trending towards the Good, the
movement of Intelligence itself led it to its fulness;
since then it was, no longer a single movement, but
a movement perfect and complete. It became all
things, and possessing self-consciousness, it recognized
that itself was all things. It thus became intelligence,
which possesses its fulness so as to contain what it
should see, and which sees by the light that it receives
from Him from whom it derives what it sees. That
is why the Good is said to be not only the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">729</a></span>
"being," but rather the cause of the vision of "being."
As for sense-objects, the sun is the cause that makes
them exist, and renders them visible, as it is also the
cause of vision, and as however the sun is neither the
vision nor the visible objects, likewise the Good is the
cause of being and of <span class="locked">intelligence,<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span> it is a light in
respect of the beings that are seen and the Intelligence
that sees them; but it is neither the beings nor the
Intelligence; it is only their cause; it produces thought
by shedding its light on the beings and on Intelligence.
It is thus that Intelligence has arrived to fulness, and
that on arriving at fulness it has become perfect and
has seen. That which preceded its fulness is its principle.
But it has another principle (which is the
Good), which is somewhat exterior to it, and which
gave it its fulness, and while giving it this fulness impressed
on it the form (of itself, the Good).</p>

<h3>ALL IS INTELLIGENCE; BUT THIS IS DIFFERENTIATED
INTO UNIVERSAL AND INDIVIDUAL.</h3>

<p>17. How can (these beings) exist within Intelligence,
and constitute it, if they were neither in that
which has given, nor in that which has received this
fulness, since, before receiving its fulness from the
Good, Intelligence had not yet received (these
beings)? It is not necessary that a principle should
itself possess what it gives; in intelligible things, it suffices
to consider the giver superior, and the receiver
inferior; that (giving and receiving) is the content of
generation in the order of veritable <span class="locked">beings.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span> What
occupies the front rank must be in actualization; posterior
things must be in potentiality of what precedes
them. What occupies the front rank is superior to what
occupies the second rank; the giver, likewise is superior
to the gift, because it is better. If then there be a Principle
anterior to actualization, it must be superior both
to actualization and to life; and because it gave life to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">730</a></span>
Intelligence it is more beautiful, still more venerable
than Life. Thus Intelligence received life, without
necessity for the principle from which it received life
having had to contain any variety. Life is the impress
of Him who gave it, but it is not his life. When Intelligence
glanced towards Him, it was indeterminate;
as soon as it fixed its glance on Him, it was determined
by Him, although He himself had no determination.
As soon indeed as Intelligence contemplated the One,
Intelligence was determined by Him, and from Him
it received its determination, limit and form. The
form exists in the receiver; the giver has none of it.
This determination has not been imposed from without
on Intelligence as is the case for the limit imposed on
some magnitude; it is the determination characteristic
of that Life, which is universal, multiple and infinite,
because it has radiated from the supreme Nature. That
Life was not yet the life of any particular principle;
otherwise, it would have been determined as an individual
life. Nevertheless it has been determined, and
by virtue of that determination it is the life of a multiple
unity. Each one of the things that constitute its
multiplicity has likewise been determined. Indeed, life
has been determined as multiplicity (of beings) because
of its own multiplicity; as unity, because of the
very determination it has received. What has been
determined as unity? Intelligence, because it is the
determined life. What was determined as multiplicity?
The multiplicity of intelligences. Everything therefore
is intelligence; only, the Intelligence that is one is
universal; while the intelligences which form multiplicity
are individual.</p>

<h3>MULTIPLICITY OF INTELLIGENCES IMPLIES THEIR
MUTUAL DIFFERENCES.</h3>

<p>If universal Intelligence comprises all the individual
intelligences, might not the latter all be identical? No,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">731</a></span>
for then there would be but one of them. The multiplicity
of the intelligences implies therefore a difference
between <span class="locked">them.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></span> But how does each differ from
the others? Its difference resides in its being one;
for there is no identity between the universal Intelligence,
and any particular intelligence. Thus, in Intelligence,
life is universal power; the vision which emanates
from it is the power of all things; and then Intelligence
itself, when it is formed, manifests all these
things to us. He who is seated above all of them is
their principle, though they do not serve Him as foundation;
for, on the contrary, He is the foundation of the
form of the first forms, without Himself having any
forms. In respect to the Soul, Intelligence plays the
part that the First plays in respect to Intelligence;
Intelligence sheds its light on the Soul, and, to determine
her, rationalizes her by communicating that
of which itself is the trace. The Intellect, therefore,
is the trace of the First; and while it is a form which
develops in plurality, the First has no shape nor form,
so as to give form to all the rest. If itself were a form,
Intelligence would be nothing more than the "reason"
(the soul).<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> That is why the First could not have
contained any multiplicity; otherwise, its multiplicity
itself would have had to be traced to some superior
principle.</p>

<h3>LIFE, INTELLIGENCE, AND IDEA BEAR THE FORM
OF THE GOOD.</h3>

<p>18. In what respects do the (entities) which are
contained by Intelligence seem to bear the form of the
Good? Is it because each of them is a form, or because
each is beautiful, or perhaps for some other
reason? All that proceeds from the Good bears its
characteristics or impressions, or at least bears something
derived from it, just as that which is derived from
the fire bears a trace of the <span class="locked">fire,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span> and as that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">732</a></span>
is derived from sweetness somehow betrays it. Now
that, which, in Intelligence, is derived from the Good
is life, for life is born from the actualization of the
Good, and from Him again is derived the beauty of
forms. Therefore all these things, life, intelligence,
and idea will bear the form of Good.</p>

<h3>THIS FORM OF THE GOOD MAY, HOWEVER, EXIST
AT VARYING DEGREES.</h3>

<p>But what element is common to them? It does not
suffice for them to proceed from the Good to have
something identical; they must also have some common
characteristic; for a same principle may give rise
to different things; or again, one and the same thing
may become different while passing from the giving
principle into the receivers; for there is a difference
between that which constitutes the first actualization,
and that which is given thereby. Thus, that which is
in the things of which we speak is already different.
Nothing hinders the characteristic of all these things
(in life, intelligence and idea) from being the form of
Good, but this form exists at different degrees in each
of them.</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE AND LIFE ARE ONLY DIFFERENT
DEGREES OF THE SAME REALITY.</h3>

<p>In which of these things does the form of the Good
inhere in the highest degree? The solution of this
problem depends on the following one. Is life a good
merely as such, even if it were life pure and simple?
Should we not rather limit that word "life" to the life
which derives from the Good, so that mere proceeding
from the Good be a sufficient characterization of life?
What is the nature of this life? Is it the life of the
Good? No: life does not belong to the Good; it only
proceeds therefrom. If the characteristic of life be
proceeding from the Good, and if it be real life, evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">733</a></span>
the result would be that nothing that proceeds
from the Good would deserve scorn, that life as life
should be considered good, that the same condition of
affairs obtains with the primary and veritable Intelligence,
and that finally each form is good and bears
the form of Good. In this case, each of these (life,
intelligence and idea) possess a good which is either
common, or different, or which is of a different degree.
Since we have admitted that each of the above-mentioned
things contains a good in its being, then it is
good chiefly because of this good. Thus life is a good,
not in so far as it is merely life, but in so far as it is
real life and proceeds from the Good. Intelligence
likewise is a good so far as it essentially is intelligence;
there is therefore some common element in life and
intelligence. Indeed, when one and the same attribute
is predicated of different beings, although it
form an integral part of their being, it may be abstracted
therefrom by thought; thus from "man" and
"horse" may be abstracted "animal"; from "water"
and "fire," "heat"; but what is common in these beings
is a genus, while what is common in intelligence and
life, is one and the same thing which inheres in one in
the first degree, and in the other in the second.</p>

<h3>IS THE WORD GOOD A COMMON LABEL OR A
COMMON QUALITY?</h3>

<p>Is it by a mere play on words that life, intelligence
and ideas are called good? Does the good constitute
their being, or is each good taken in its totality? Good
could not constitute the being of each of them. Are
they then parts of the Good? The Good, however,
is indivisible. The things that are beneath it are good
for different reasons. The primary actualization (that
proceeds from the Good) is good; likewise, the determination
it receives is good, and the totality of both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">734</a></span>
things is good. The actualization is good because it
proceeds from the Good; the determination, because it
is a perfection that has emanated from the Good; and
the combination of actualization and determination
because it is their totality. All these things thus are
derived from one and the same principle, but nevertheless
they are different. Thus (in a choric ballet)
the voice and the step proceed from one and the same
person, in that they are all perfectly regulated. Now
they are well regulated because they contain order and
rhythm. What then is the content in the above-mentioned
things that would make them good? But perhaps
it may be objected that if the voice and step are
well regulated, each one of them entirely owes it to
some external principle, since the order is here applied
to the things that differ from each other. On the contrary,
the things of which we speak are each of them
good in itself. And why are they good? It does not
suffice to say that they are good because they proceed
from the Good. Doubtless we shall have to grant
that they are precious from the moment that they proceed
from the Good, but reason demands that we shall
determine that of which their goodness consists.</p>

<h3>GOOD CANNOT BE A DESIRE OF THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>19. Shall the decision of what is good be entrusted
to the desire of the soul?<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> If we are to trust this affection
of the soul, we shall be declaring that whatever
is desirable for her is good; but we would not be seeking
why the Good is desired. Thus, while we use demonstrations
to explain the nature of every entity, we would
be trusting to desire for the determination of the Good.
Such a proceeding would land us in several absurdities.
First, the Good would only be an attribute. Then,
since our soul has several desires, and each of the latter
has different objects, we would not be able to decide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">735</a></span>
which of these objects would be the best, according to
desire. It would be impossible to decide what would
be better before we know what is good.</p>

<h3>NO NEED TO SEEK THE CAUSE OF GOOD AS IN THE
INTELLIGIBLE THE CAUSE COINCIDES WITH
THE NATURE.</h3>

<p>Shall we then define the good as the virtue characteristic
of each being (as say the Stoics)? In this
case, by strictly following (the course of dialectics) we
would reduce the Good to being a form and a reason.
But, having arrived there, what should we answer if
we were asked on what grounds these things themselves
are good? In imperfect things, it seems easy
to distinguish the good, even though it be not pure;
but in intelligible things we may not immediately succeed
in discovering the Good by comparison with the
inferior things. As there is no evil on high (in the
intelligible world), and as excellent things exist in
themselves, we find ourselves embarrassed. Perhaps
we are embarrassed only because we seek the cause
("whyness") (of the good), whereas the cause
("whyness") is here identical with the nature ("whatness"),
as intelligible entities are good in themselves.
Nor would we have solved the problem if we were to
assign some other cause (of the Good), such as the
divinity, to which our reason has not yet forced us to
repair. However, we cannot retire, and we must seek
to arrive by some other road to something satisfactory.</p>

<h3>PYTHAGOREAN OPPOSITIONS ARE ALSO WORTHLESS
AS EXPLANATIONS OF GOOD.</h3>

<p>20. Since therefore we have given up desires as
forms in the determination of the nature and quality
(of the good), shall we have recourse to other rules,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">736</a></span>
such as, for instance (the <span class="locked">Pythagorean<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span>) "oppositions,"
such as order and disorder, proportion and disproportion,
health and sickness, form and formlessness,
being and destruction, consistence and its lack? Who
indeed would hesitate to attribute to the form of good
those characteristics which constitute the first member
of each of these opposition-pairs? If so, the efficient
causes of these characteristics will also have to be
traced to the good; for virtue, life, intelligence and
wisdom are comprised within the form of good, as
being things desired by the soul that is wise.</p>

<h3>GOOD NOT DEFINED BY INTELLIGENCE, AS THE
SOUL HAS OTHER ASPIRATIONS.</h3>

<p>It will further be suggested (by followers of Aristotle)
that we stop at Intelligence, predicating goodness
of it. For life and soul are images of Intelligence.
It is to Intelligence that the soul aspires, it is according
to Intelligence that the soul judges, it is on Intelligence
that the soul regulates herself, when she pronounces
that justice is better than injustice, in preferring every
kind of virtue to every kind of vice, and in holding in
high estimation what she considers preferable. Unfortunately,
the soul does not aspire to Intelligence exclusively.
As might be demonstrated in a long discussion,
Intelligence is not the supreme goal to which
we aspire, and not everything aspires to Intelligence,
whilst everything aspires to the Good. The (beings)
which do not possess intelligence do not all seek to
possess it, while those who do possess it, do not limit
themselves to it. Intelligence is sought only as the
result of a train of reasoning, whilst Good is desired
even before reason comes into play. If the object of
desire be to live, to exist always, and to be active, this
object is not desired because of Intelligence, but because
of its being good, inasmuch as the Good is its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">737</a></span>
principle and its goal. It is only in this respect that
life is desirable.</p>

<h3>THE GOOD IS INTELLIGENCE AND PRIMARY LIFE.</h3>

<p>21. What then is the one and only cause to whose
presence is due the goodness (of life, intelligence and
idea)? Let us not hesitate to say: Intelligence and
primary Life bear the form of Good; it is on this account
alone that they are desirable; they bear the form
of Good in this respect, that the primary Life is the
actualization of the Good, or rather the actualization
that proceeds from the Good, and that intelligence is
determination of this actualization. (Intelligence and
primary Life) are fascinating, and the soul seeks them
because they proceed from the Good; nevertheless the
soul aspires to them (only) because they fit her, and
not because they are good in themselves. On the
other hand, the soul could not disdain them because
they bear the form of good; <span class="locked">though<a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span> we can disdain
something even though it be suitable to us, if it be
not a good <span class="locked">besides.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span> It is true that we permit ourselves
to be allured by distant and inferior objects, and
may even feel for them a passionate love; but that
occurs only when they have something more than their
natural condition, and when some perfection descends
on them from on high. Just as the bodies, while containing
a light mingled with their (substance), nevertheless
need illumination by some other light to bring
out their <span class="locked">colors,<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></span> so the intelligible entities, in spite
of the light that they contain, need to receive some
other more powerful light, so as to become visible,
both for themselves, and for others.</p>

<h3>GOOD CONSISTS IN ILLUMINATION BY THE
EXTREME.</h3>

<p>22. When the soul perceives the light thus shed by
the Good on the intelligible entities, she flies towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">738</a></span>
them, tasting an indescribable bliss in the contemplation
of the light that illuminates them. Likewise here
below, we do not like the bodies for themselves, but
for the beauty that shimmers in <span class="locked">them.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></span> Each intelligible
entity owes its nature to none but to itself; but
it only becomes desirable when the Good, so to speak,
illuminates and colors it, breathing grace into the desired
object, and inspiring love into the desiring heart.
As soon as the soul reacts to the influence of the Good,
she feels emotion, swells with fancy, is stung by desire,
and love is born within <span class="locked">her.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></span> Before reacting to the
influence of good she feels no transports when facing
the beauty of Intelligence; for this beauty is dead so
long as it is not irradiated by the Good. Consequently
the soul still remains depressed and bowed down, cold
and torpid, in front of Intelligence. But as soon as
she feels the gentle warmth of the Good, she is refreshed,
she awakes, and spreads her wings; and instead
of stopping to admire the Intelligence in front of her,
she rises by the aid of reminiscence to a still higher
principle (the First). So long as there is anything
superior to what she possesses, she rises, allured by her
natural leaning for the Inspirer of love; so she passes
through the region of Intelligence, and stops at the
Good because there is nothing beyond. So long as she
contemplates Intelligence, she surely enjoys a noble
and magnificent spectacle, but she does not yet fully
possess the object of her search. Such would be a
human countenance, which, in spite of its beauty, is
not attractive, for lack of the charm of grace. Beauty
is, indeed, rather the splendor that enhalos proportion,
than proportion itself; and it is properly this splendor
which challenges love. Why indeed does beauty shine
radiantly on the face of a living person, and yet leave
hardly a trace after death, even when the complexion
and features are not yet marred? Why, among different
statues, do the most life-like ones seem more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">739</a></span>
beautiful than others that may be better proportioned?
Why is a living being, though ugly, more beautiful than
a pictured one, even though the latter were the most
handsome imaginable? The secret is that the living
form seems to us most desirable, because it possesses
a living soul, because it is most assimilated to the
Good; because the soul is colored by the light of the
Good, and because, enlightened by the Good she is
more wakeful and lighter, and because in her turn she
lightens the burdens, awakes, and causes participation
of the Good, so far as she may be able, in the body
within which she resides.</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME IS THE GOOD BECAUSE OF HIS
SUPREMACY.</h3>

<p>23. Since it is this Principle which the soul pursues,
which illuminates Intelligence, and whose least
trace arouses in us so great an emotion, there is no
ground for astonishment if it possess the power of
exerting its fascination on all beings, and if all rest in
Him without seeking anything beyond. If indeed
everything proceeds from this principle, then there is
nothing better, and everything else is below Him.
Now, how could the best of beings fail to be the Good?
If the Good be entirely self-sufficient, and have need
of nothing else, what could it be except the One who
was what He is before all other things, when evil did
not yet exist? If all evils be posterior to Him, if they
exist only in the objects that in no way participate in
the Good, and which occupy the last rank, if no evil
exist among the intelligibles, and if there be nothing
worse than evil (just as there is nothing better than
the Good), then evils are in complete opposition to
this principle, and it could be nothing else. To deny
the existence of the Good, we would also have to deny
the existence of evil; and the result would be a complete
indifference of choice between any two particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">740</a></span>
things; which is absurd. All other things called good
refer to Him, while He refers to nothing else.</p>

<h3>THE GOOD AS CREATOR AND PRESERVER.</h3>

<p>But if this be the nature of the Good, what does He
do? He made Intelligence, and life. By the intermediation
of Intelligence, He made the souls and all
the other beings that participate in Intelligence, in
Reason, or in Life. Moreover, who could express
the goodness of Him who is their source and principle?
But what is He doing at the present time? He preserves
what He has begotten, He inspires the thought
in those who think, He vivifies the living, by His
<span class="locked">spirit,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></span> He imparts to all (beings) intelligence and
life, and to those who are unable to receive life, at
least existence.</p>

<h3>MANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE GOOD;
FOR THE INDIVIDUAL IT IS ILLUMINATION.</h3>

<p>24. And what is He doing for us? To answer this
question, we would still have to explain the light by
which Intelligence is illuminated, and in which the Soul
participates. But we shall have to postpone this discussion,
and mention various other questions which
may be asked. Is the Good goodness, and does it receive
this name because it is desirable for some being?
Is that which is desirable for some being the good of
this being, and do we call the Good that which is desirable
for all beings? Is being desirable not rather
a simple characteristic of the Good, and must not that
which is desirable have a nature such that it would
deserve the name of Good?<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> Besides, do the beings
that desire the Good desire it because they receive
from it something, or merely because possession thereof
causes bliss? If they do receive something from it,
what does it consist of? If the possession of the Good
give them joy, why should their joy come from possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">741</a></span>
of the Good, rather than from possession of
anything else? ls the Good such by what is characteristic
of it, or by something else? Is the Good an attribute
of some other being, or is the Good good for
itself? Must not the Good rather be good for others,
without being good for itself? For whom anyway is
the Good good? For there is a certain nature (matter)
for which nothing is good.</p>

<h3>ATTRIBUTING GOOD TO LIFE IS ONLY THE RESULT
OF FEAR OF DEATH.</h3>

<p>Nor can we ignore an objection raised by an opponent
who is difficult to convince (Plato's Philebus):
"Well, my friends, what then is this entity that you
celebrate in such pompous terms, ceaselessly repeating
that life and intelligence are goods, although you said
that the Good is above them? What sort of a good
might the Intellect be? What sort of a good should
(a man) have, who thinks the Ideas themselves, contemplating
everything in itself? Perhaps, indeed, a
man, when he enjoys these (Ideas and contemplations),
might be deceived into calling them a good merely
because he happened to be in pleasant circumstances;
but should these circumstances become unpleasant, on
what grounds would he call them a good? Merely because
they (possess) existence? But what pleasure
or benefit could this afford him? If he did not consider
self-love as the foundation thereof, what difference
could there be for him between existence and non-existence?
It is therefore to this natural physical error
(of self-love), and to the fear of death, that we must
trace the cause of the ascription of good to intelligence
and <span class="locked">life."<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span></p>

<h3>PLATO'S ANSWER TO PHILEBUS: THERE ARE TWO
GOODS, THE HUMAN AND THE UNIVERSAL.</h3>

<p>25. Plato therefore mingled the Good with
pleasure, and did not posit the Good exclusively in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">742</a></span>
Intelligence, as he wrote in the <span class="locked">Philebus.<a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></span> Appreciating
this difficulty, he very rightly decided on one
hand that good did not consist in pleasure alone, and
on the other, that it did not consist in intelligence alone,
inasmuch as he failed to discover in it anything to
arouse our desire. Perhaps Plato had still another
motive (in calling the Good a mixture), because he
thought that, with such a nature, the Good is necessarily
full of charm, desirable both for the seeker and
the finder; whence it would result that he who is not
charmed has not found the Good, and that, if he who
desires be not happy, he evidently does not yet possess
the Good. It is not without a reason (that Plato
formed this conception of the Good); for he was not
seeking to determine the universal Good, but the good
of man; and as such human good refers to (man, who
is) a being different from the absolute Good, then it
becomes for him something different from the Good in
itself; and would therefore be defective and composite.
That is why (according to Plato), that which is alone
and single has no good, but is good in another and a
higher sense.</p>

<h3>THE ARISTOTELIAN SUPREME <span class="locked">GOOD.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></span></h3>

<p>The good must then be desirable; but it is good not
because it is desirable, but it is desirable because it is
<span class="locked">good.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></span> Thus in the order of beings, rising from the
last to the First, it will be found that the good of each
of them is in the one immediately preceding, so long
as this ascending scale remain proportionate and increasing.
Then we will stop at Him who occupies the
supreme rank, beyond which there is nothing more to
seek. That is the First, the veritable, the sovereign
Good, the author of all goodness in other beings. The
good of matter is form; for if matter became capable
of sensation it would receive it with pleasure. The good
of the body is the soul; for without her it could neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">743</a></span>
exist nor last. The good of the soul is virtue; and then
higher (waits), Intelligence. Last, the good of Intelligence
is the principle called the Primary nature.
Each of these goods produces something within the
object whose good it is. It confers order and beauty
(as form does on matter); or life (as the soul does on
the body); or wisdom and happiness (as intelligence
does on soul). Last, the Good communicates to
Intelligence its influx, and actualization emanating
from the Good, and shedding on Intelligence what has
been called the light of the Good. The nature of this
we shall study later.</p>

<h3>THE TRUE GOOD IMPLIES A COUNTERFEIT GOOD.</h3>

<p>26. Recognition of goodness and so-called "possession"
thereof consist of enjoyment of the presence
of good by the being who has received from nature
the faculty of sensation. How could it make a mistake
about the matter? The possibility of its being
deceived implies the existence of some counterfeit; in
this case, the error of this being was caused by that
which resembled its good; for this being withdraws
from what had deceived it as soon as the Good presents
itself. The existence of a particular good for
each being is demonstrated by its desire and inclination.
Doubtless, the inanimate being receives its good
from without; but, in the animated being, the desire
spontaneously starts to pursue the Good. That is why
lifeless bodies are the objects of solicitude and care
of living beings, while the living beings watch over
themselves.</p>

<h3>THE GOOD CANNOT BE PLEASURE WHICH IS
CHANGEABLE AND RESTLESS.</h3>

<p>Now when a being has attained the good it was
pursuing it is sure of possessing it as soon as it feels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">744</a></span>
that it is better, feels no regret, is satisfied, takes
pleasure therein, and seeks nothing beyond. What
shows the insufficiency of pleasure is that one does not
always like the same thing; doubtless pleasure ever
charms, but the object which produces it is not the
same; it is always the newest object that pleases most.
Now the good to which we aspire must not be a simple
affection, existing only in him who feels it; for he who
mistakes this affection for the Good remains unsatisfied,
he has nothing but an affection that somebody
else might equally feel in presence of the Good. Consequently
no one will succeed in making himself enjoy
a pleasure he has not <span class="locked">achieved<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></span>; such as, for instance,
rejoicing in the presence of an absent son; or, for a
glutton to relish imaginary food; or, for a lover, to
tremble at the touch of his absent mistress, or (to thrill
in a theoretic) orgasm.</p>

<h3>A THING'S GOOD IS ITS FORM; OR, ITS INTIMACY
WITH ITSELF.</h3>

<p>27. What is the essential of a being's nature?
Form. Matter achieves (recognition) through its form;
and a soul's destiny is realized by the virtue which is its
form. Next we may ask whether this form be a good
for a being merely because it suits its (nature)? Does
desire pursue that which is suitable to it, or not? No:
a being is suited by its like; now, though a being seek
and love its like, its possession does not imply the
possession of its good. Are we then not implying that
something is suitable to a being, on the strength of its
being the good of that being? The determination of
what is suitable to a being belongs to the superior
Being of whom the lower being is a potentiality. When
a being is the potentiality of some other, the being
needs the other; now the Being which it needs because
it is superior is, by that very fact, its good. Of all things
matter is the most indigent, and the form suitable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">745</a></span>
it is the last of all; but, above it, one may gradually
ascend. Consequently, if a being be good for itself, so
much the more will it consider good what is its perfection
and form, namely, the being that is better than
it, because of a superior nature, and of supplying the
good (of the lower being). But why should that
which a being receives from a superior Being be its
good? Is it not this because it is eminently suited to
it? No: It is so merely because it is a portion of the
Good. That is why the purest and best Beings are
those that have most intimacy with <span class="locked">themselves.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></span>
Besides it is absurd to seek the cause why what is good,
is good for itself; as if, by the mere fact of its being
good, it should betray its own nature and not love itself.
Nevertheless, speaking of simple beings, it might be
asked whether a being which does not contain several
things different from each other either possesses intimacy
with itself, or can be good for itself.</p>

<h3>PLEASURE MAY ACCOMPANY THE GOOD, BUT THE
GOOD IS INDEPENDENT THEREOF.</h3>

<p>Now, if all that has been said be right, it is only
a gradual upward analysis that reveals the good that
is suitable to the nature of any being. Desire does not
constitute the good, but is born from its presence.
Those who acquire the good receive something from
it. Pleasure accompanies the acquirement of good;
but even should pleasure not accompany the good, the
good should, none the less be chosen, and sought for
its own sake.</p>

<h3>MATTER IS IMPROVED BY FORM, THE DREAM OF
THE GOOD.</h3>

<p>28. Let us consider the implications of the principles
we have studied. If that which a being receives
as good be everywhere a form, if the good of matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">746</a></span>
be a form, we might ask ourselves whether matter,
granting it here the faculty of volition, would even
wish to be a form? Such a wish would be tantamount
to a wish to be destroyed. (But matter could not wish
this), for every being seeks its own good. But perhaps
matter might not wish to be matter, but simply
to be essence; possessing which, matter would wish to
free itself from all the evil within it. But how can that
which is evil (for such is the nature of matter) desire
the good?<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> Besides, we are not attributing desire to
matter itself. It was only to meet the exigencies of the
discussion that we employed the hypothesis which accorded
sensibility to matter, if indeed it can be granted
to matter without destroying its nature. We have at
least shown that when form has come, as a dream of
the <span class="locked">Good,<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></span> to unite itself to matter, the latter found
itself in a better condition.</p>

<h3>MATTER IS NOT WICKEDNESS, BUT NEUTRAL EVIL.</h3>

<p>All we have said above goes on the assumption that
matter is the evil. But if it were something else, as,
for instance, malice, and if the essence of matter were
to receive sensation, would intimacy with what is better
still be the good of matter? But if it were not the
malice itself of matter which choose the good, it was
what had become evil in matter. If the essence (of
matter) were identical with evil, how could matter
wish to possess this good? Would evil love itself, if
it had self-consciousness? But how could that which
is not lovable be loved? For we have demonstrated
that a being's good does not consist in that which is
suitable to it. Enough about this, however.</p>

<h3>THE GOOD IS A NATURE WHICH POSSESSES NO
KIND OF FORM ITSELF.</h3>

<p>But if the good be everywhere a form; if, in the
measure that one rises (along the ladder of beings),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">747</a></span>
there is a progression in the form&mdash;for the soul is
more of a form than the form of the body; in the
soul herself there are graduated forms, and intelligence
is more of a form than the soul&mdash;the good follows a
progression evidently inverse to that of matter; the
Good exists in that which is purified and freed from
matter, and exists there in proportion to its purity
(from matter); so it exists in the highest degree in
that which lays aside all materiality. Finally, the
Good in itself, being entirely separated from all
matter; or rather, never having had any contact with
it, constitutes a nature which has no kind of form,
and from which proceeds the first form (Intelligence).
But of this more <span class="locked">later.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></span></p>

<h3>THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE GOOD FROM PLEASURE
PROVED BY THE TEMPERATE MAN.</h3>

<p>29. Supposing then that the pleasure does not accompany
the good, but that anterior to pleasure there
have existed something which would have naturally
given rise to it (because of its goodness); why then
might not the good be considered lovable? But the
mere assertion that good is lovable, already implies
that it is accompanied by pleasure. But supposing now
that the good could exist without being lovable
(and consequently not accompanied by pleasure).
In that case, even in presence of the good, the being
that possesses sensibility will not know that the good
is present. What would however hinder a being from
knowing the presence of the good without feeling any
emotion at its possession, which would exactly represent
the case of the temperate man who lacks nothing?
The result would be that pleasure could not be suitable
to the First (being), not only because He is simple,
but also because pleasure results from the acquisition
of what is lacking (and the First lacks nothing, therefore
could not feel pleasure).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">748</a></span></p>

<h3>EVEN SCORN OF LIFE IMPLIES THE EXISTENCE OF
THE GOOD.</h3>

<p>But, in order that this truth may appear in its full
light, we shall first have to clear away all the other
opinions, and especially have to refute the teaching
opposite to ours. This is the question asked of us:
"What will be the fruit gathered by him who has the intelligence
necessary to acquire one of these goods (such
as existence and life), if on hearing them named, he
be not impressed thereby, because he does not understand
them, either because they seem to him no more
than words, or because his conception of each of these
things should differ (from our view of them), or because
in his search for the Good he seeks some sense-object,
such as wealth, or the like?" The person who
thus scorns these things (existence and life), thereby
implicitly recognizes that there is within him a certain
good, but that, without knowing in what it consists,
he nevertheless values these things according to his
own notion of the Good; for it is impossible to say,
"that is not the good," without having some sort of
knowledge of the <span class="locked">good,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></span> or acquaintance therewith.
The above speaker seems to betray a suspicion that the
Good in itself is above Intelligence. Besides, if in considering
the Good in itself, or the good which most
approaches it, he do not discern it, he will nevertheless
succeed in getting a conception of it by its contraries;
otherwise, he would not even know that the
lack of intelligence is an evil, though every man desire
to be intelligent, and glory in being such, as is seen
by the sensations which aspire to become notions. If
intelligence, and especially primary Intelligence, be
beautiful and venerable, what admiration might not
then be felt by him who could contemplate the generating
principle, the Father of Intelligence?<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> Consequently,
he who affects to scorn existence and life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">749</a></span>
receives a refutation from himself and from all the
affections he feels. They who are disgusted of life
are those who consider not the true life, but the life
which is mingled with death.</p>

<h3>TWO INTERPRETATIONS OF PLATO'S OPINION
ABOUT THE GOOD.</h3>

<p>30. Now, rising in thought to the Good, we must
examine whether pleasure must be mingled with the
Good to keep life from remaining imperfect, even if
we should, besides, contemplate the divine things, and
even Him who is their principle. When (Plato<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>)
seems to believe that the good is composed of intelligence,
as subject, and also of affection which wisdom
makes the soul experience, he is not asserting that this
blend (of intelligence and pleasure) is either the goal
(of the soul), or the Good in itself. He only means
that intelligence is the good, and that we enjoy its
possession. This is a first interpretation of (Plato's)
opinion about the Good. Another interpretation is that
to mingle intelligence with pleasure is to make a single
subject of both of them, so that in acquiring or in contemplating
such an intelligence we possess the good;
for (according to the partisans of this opinion), one
of these things could not exist in isolation, nor, supposing
that it could so exist, it would not be desirable
as a good. But (shall we ask them), how can intelligence
be mingled with pleasure so as to form a perfect
fusion therewith? Nobody could be made to
believe that the pleasure of the body could be mingled
with Intelligence; such pleasure is incompatible even
with the joys of the soul.</p>

<h3>PLEASURE IS INDEED AN ACCESSORY TO ALL GOODS
OF THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>The element of truth in all this, however, is that
every action, disposition and life is joined by some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">750</a></span>
accessory (pleasure or pain) that unites with it. Indeed,
sometimes action meets an obstacle to its natural
accomplishment, and life is affected by the mixture of
a little of its contrary, which limits its independence;
sometimes, however, action is produced without anything
troubling its purity and serenity, and then life
flows along a tranquil course. Those who consider
that this state of intelligence is desirable, and preferable
to everything else, in their inability to express their
thoughts more definitely, say that it is mingled with
pleasure. Such likewise is the meaning of expressions
used by those who apply to divine things terms intended
to express joy here below, and who say, "He is intoxicated
with nectar! Let us to the banquet! Jupiter
smiles!"<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> This happy state of intelligence is that
which is the most agreeable, the most worthy of our
wishes, and of our love; nor is it transitory, and does
not consist in a movement; its principle is that which
colors intelligence, illumines it, and makes it enjoy a
sweet serenity. That is why <span class="locked">Plato<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></span> adds to the mixture
truth, and puts above it that which gives measure.
He also adds that the proportion and the beauty which
are in the mixture pass from there into the beautiful.
That is the good that belongs to us, that is the fate
that awaits us. That is the supreme object of desire,
an object that we will achieve on condition of drawing
ourselves up to that which is best in us. Now this
thing full of proportion and beauty, this form composed
(of the elements of which we have spoken),
is nothing else but a life full of radiance, intelligence
and beauty.</p>

<h3>THE SOUL SCORNING ALL THINGS BELOW RISES
TO THE GOOD.</h3>

<p>31. Since all things have been embellished by Him
who is above them, and have received their light from
Him; since Intelligence derives from Him the splendor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751">751</a></span>
of its intellectual actualization; by which splendor it
illuminates nature; since from Him also the soul derives
her vital power, because she finds in Him an
abundant source of life; consequently, Intelligence has
risen to Him, and has remained attached to Him, satisfied
in the bliss of His presence; consequently also
the soul, to the utmost of her ability, turned towards
Him, for, as soon as she has known Him and seen
Him, she was, by her contemplation, filled with bliss;
and, so far as she could see Him, she was overwhelmed
with reverence. She could not see Him without being
impressed with the feeling that she had within herself
something of Him; it was this disposition of hers that
led her to desire to see Him, as the image of some
lovable object makes one wish to be able to contemplate
it oneself. Here below, lovers try to resemble
the beloved object, to render their body more gracious,
to conform their soul to their model, by temperance
and the other virtues to remain as little inferior as possible
to Him whom they love, for fear of being scorned
by Him; and thus they succeed in enjoying intimacy
with <span class="locked">Him.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></span> Likewise, the soul loves the Good, because,
from the very beginning she is provoked to love
Him. When she is ready to love, she does not wait
for the beauties here below to give her the reminiscence
of the Good; full of love, even when she does not
know what she possesses, she is ever seeking; and
inflamed with the desire to rise to the Good, she scorns
the things here below. Considering the beauties presented
by our universe, she suspects that they are
deceptive, because she sees them clothed upon with
flesh, and united to our bodies, soiled by the matter
where they reside, divided by extension, and she does
not recognize them as real beauties, for she cannot
believe that the latter could plunge into the mire of
these bodies, soiling and obscuring <span class="locked">themselves.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></span> Last,
when the soul observes that the beauties here below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">752</a></span>
are in a perpetual flux, she clearly recognizes that they
derive this splendor with which they shine, from <span class="locked">elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></span>
Then she rises to the intelligible world;
being capable of discovering what she loves, she does
not stop before having found it, unless she be made
to lose her love. Having arrived there, she contemplates
all the true beauties, the true <span class="locked">realities<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></span>; she
refreshes herself by filling herself up with the life
proper to essence. She herself becomes genuine essence.
She fuses with the Intelligible which she really
possesses, and in its presence she has the feeling (of
having found) what she was seeking so long.</p>

<h3>THE AUTHOR OF THIS PERFECTION MUST BE
ABOVE IT.</h3>

<p>32. Where then is He who has created this venerable
beauty, and this perfect life? Where is He who
has begotten "being"? Do you see the beauty that
shines in all these forms so various? It is well to dwell
there; but when one has thus arrived at beauty, one is
forced to seek the source of these essences and of their
beauty. Their author Himself cannot be any of them;
for then He would be no more than some among them,
and a part of the whole. He is therefore none of the
particular forms, nor a particular power, nor all of the
forms, nor all the powers that are, or are becoming,
in the universe; He must be superior to all the forms
and all the powers. The supreme Principle therefore
has no form; not indeed that He lacks any; but because
He is the principle from which all intellectual shapes
are derived. Whatever is born&mdash;that is, if there be
anything such as birth&mdash;must, at birth, have been
some particular being, and have had its particular
shape; but who could have made that which was not
made by anybody? He therefore is all beings, without
being any of them; He is none of the other beings
because He is anterior to all of them; He is all other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753">753</a></span>
beings because He is their author. What greatness
shall be attributed to the Principle who can do all
things? Will He be considered infinite? Even if He
be infinite, He will have no greatness, for magnitude
occurs only among beings of the lowest rank. The
creator of magnitude could not himself have any magnitude;
and even what is called magnitude in "being"
is not a quantity. Magnitude can be found only in
something posterior to being. The magnitude of the
Good is that there be nothing more powerful than He,
nothing that even equals Him. How indeed could any
of the beings dependent on Him ever equal Him, not
having a nature identical with His? Even the statement
that God is always and everywhere does not
attribute to Him any measure, nor even, a lack of
measure&mdash;otherwise, He might be considered as
measuring the rest; nor does it attribute to Him any
figure (or, outward appearance).</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME IS LIMITLESS.</h3>

<p>Thus the Divinity, being the object of desire, must
be the most desired and the most loved, precisely because
He has no figure nor shape. The love He inspires
is immense; this love is limitless, because of the
limitlessness of its object. He is infinite, because the
beauty of its object surpasses all beauty. Not being
any essence, how indeed could the (divinity) have any
determinate beauty? As supreme object of love, He
is the creator of <span class="locked">beauty.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></span> Being the generating power
of all that is beautiful, He is at the same time the
flower in which beauty <span class="locked">blooms<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></span>: for He produces it,
and makes it more beautiful still by the superabundance
of beauty which He sheds on her. He is therefore
simultaneously the principle and goal of <span class="locked">beauty.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></span> As
principle of beauty, He beautifies all that of which He
is the principle. It is not however by shape that He
beautifies; what He produces has no shape, or, to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_754" id="Page_754">754</a></span>
more accurately, He has a shape in a sense different
from the habitual meaning of this term. The shape
which is no more than a shape is a simple attribute of
some substance, while the Shape that subsists in itself
is superior to shape. Thus, that which participates in
beauty was a shape; but beauty itself has none.</p>

<h3>ABSOLUTE BEAUTY IS A FORMLESS SHAPE.</h3>

<p>33. When we speak of absolute Beauty, we must
therefore withdraw from all determinate shape, setting
none before the eyes (of our mind); otherwise, we
would expose ourselves to descending from absolute
beauty to something which does not deserve the name
of beauty but by virtue of an obscure and feeble <span class="locked">participation<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></span>;
while absolute Beauty is a shapeless form,
if it be at all allowed to be an idea (or form). Thus
you may approach the universal Shape only by abstraction.
Abstract even the form found in the reason
(that is, the essence), by which we distinguish one
action from another. Abstract, for instance, the difference
that separates temperance from justice, though
both be beautiful. For by the mere fact that intelligence
conceives an object as something proper, the
object that it conceives is diminished, even though this
object were the totality of intelligible entities; and,
on the other hand, if each of them, taken apart, have
a single form, nevertheless all taken together will offer
a certain variety.</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME IS ESSENTIAL BEAUTY; THE SHAPELESS
SHAPER; TRANSCENDENT.</h3>

<p>We still have to study the proper conception of Him
who is superior to the Intelligence that is so universally
beautiful and varied, but who Himself is not varied.
To Him the soul aspires without knowing why she
wishes to possess Him; but reason tells us He is essential
beauty, since the nature of Him who is excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">755</a></span>
and sovereignly lovable cannot absolutely have any
form. That is why the soul, whatever object you may
show her in your process of reducing an object to a
form, ever seeks beyond the shaping principle. Now
reason tells us in respect to anything that has a shape,
that as a shape or form is something measured (or
limited), (anything shaped) cannot be genuinely universal,
absolute, and beautiful in itself, and that its
beauty is a mixture. Therefore though the intelligible
entities be beautiful (they are limited); while He who
is essential beauty, or rather the super-beautiful, must
be unlimited, and consequently have no shape or form.
He who then is beauty in the first degree, and primary
Beauty, is superior to form, and the splendor of the
intelligible (world) is only a reflection of the nature
of the Good.</p>

<h3>THUS LOVE BEGINS PHYSICALLY BUT BECOMES
SPIRITUAL.</h3>

<p>This is proved by what happens to lovers; so far as
their eyes remain fixed on a sense-object, they do
not yet love genuinely. Love is born only when
they rise above the sense-object, and arrive at
representing in their indivisible soul an image which
has nothing more of sensation. To calm the ardor that
devours them they do indeed still desire to contemplate
the beloved object; but as soon as they come to
understand that they have to rise to something beyond
the form, they desire the latter; for since the very
beginning they felt within themselves the love for a
great light inspired by a feeble glow. The Shape indeed
is the trace of the shapeless. Without himself having
any shape, He begets shape whenever matter approaches
Him. Now matter must necessarily be very
distant from Him, because matter does not possess
forms of even the last degree. Since form inherent in
matter is derived from the soul, not even mere form-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">756</a></span>
matter is lovable in itself, as matter; and as
the soul herself is a still higher form, but yet is
inferior to and less lovable than intelligence, there is
no escape from the conclusion that the primary nature
of the Beautiful is superior to form.</p>

<h3>THE FORMLESSNESS OF THE SUPREME IS PROVED
BY THE FACT THAT THE SOUL WHEN APPROACHING
HIM SPONTANEOUSLY
RIDS HERSELF OF FORMS.</h3>

<p>34. We shall not be surprised that the soul's
liveliest transports of love are aroused by Him, who
has no form, not even an intelligible one, when we
observe that the soul herself, as soon as she burns with
love for Him, lays aside all forms soever, even if intelligible;
for it is impossible to approach Him so long
as one considers anything else. The soul must therefore
put aside all evil, and even all good; in a word,
everything, of whatever nature, to receive the divinity,
alone with the alone. When the soul obtains this
happiness, and when (the divinity) comes to her, or
rather, when He manifests His presence, because the
soul has detached herself from other present things,
when she has embellished herself as far as possible,
when she has become assimilated to Him by means
known only to the initiated, she suddenly sees Him
appear in her. No more interval between them, no
more doubleness; the two fuse in one. It is impossible
to distinguish the soul from the divinity, so much
does she enjoy His presence; and it is the intimacy
of this union that is here below imitated by those who
love and are loved, when they consummate union. In
this condition the soul no longer feels (her body);
she no more feels whether she be alive, human, essence,
universality, or anything else. Consideration
of objects would be a degradation, and the soul then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_757" id="Page_757">757</a></span>
has neither the leisure nor the desire to busy herself
with them. When, after having sought the divinity,
she finds herself in His presence, she rushes towards
Him, and contemplates Him instead of <span class="locked">herself.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></span> What
is her condition at the time? She has not the leisure to
consider it; but she would not exchange it for anything
whatever, not even for the whole heaven; for
there is nothing superior or better; she could not rise
any higher. As to other things, however elevated they
be, she cannot at that time stoop to consider them.
It is at this moment that the soul starts to move, and
recognizes that she really possesses what she desired;
she at last affirms that there is nothing better than
Him. No illusion could occur there; for where could
she find anything truer than truth itself? The soul
then is what she affirms; (or rather), she asserts it
(only), later, and then she asserts it by keeping silence.
While tasting this beatitude she could not err in the
assertion that she tastes it. If she assert that she
tastes it, it is not that her body experiences an agreeable
titillation, for she has only become again what she
formerly used to be when she became happy. All the
things that formerly charmed her, such as commanding
others, power, wealth, beauty, science, now seem to
her despicable; she could not scorn them earlier, for
she had not met anything better. Now she fears
nothing, so long as she is with Him, and contemplates
Him. Even with pleasure would she witness the destruction
of everything, for she would remain alone
with Him; so great is her felicity.</p>

<h3>THE SOUL SCORNS EVEN THOUGHT: SHE IS INTELLECTUALIZED
AND ENNOBLED.</h3>

<p>35. Such, then, is the state of the soul that she no
longer values even thought, which formerly excited
her admiration; for thought is a movement, and the
soul would prefer none. She does not even assert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">758</a></span>
that it is Intelligence that she sees, though she contemplate
only because she has become intelligence,
and has, so to speak, become intellectualized, by being
established in the intelligible place. Having arrived to
Intelligence, and having become established therein,
the soul possesses the intelligible, and thinks; but as
soon as she achieves the vision of the supreme Divinity,
she abandons everything else. She behaves as does
the visitor who, on entering into a palace, would first
admire the different beauties that adorn its interior,
but who regards them no longer as soon as she perceives
the master; for the master, by his (living)
nature, which is superior to all the statues that adorn
the palace, monopolizes the consideration, and alone
deserves to be contemplated; consequently the spectator,
with his glance fixed on Him, henceforward observes
Him alone. By dint of continual contemplation
of the spectacle in front of him, the spectator sees the
master no longer; in the spectator, vision confuses
with the visible object. What for the spectator first
was a visible object, in him becomes vision, and makes
him forget all that he saw around himself. To complete
this illustration, the master here presenting himself
to the visitor must be no man, but a divinity; and
this divinity must not content Himself with appearing
to the eyes of him who contemplates Him, but He must
penetrate within the human soul, and fill her entirely.</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE HAS THE TWO POWERS OF INTELLIGENCE
AND LOVE.</h3>

<p>Intelligence has two powers: by the first, which is
her own power of thinking, she sees what is within
her. By the other she perceives what is above her
by the aid of a kind of vision and perception; by the
vision, she first saw simply; then, by (perceptive)
seeing, she received intellection and fused with the
One. The first kind of contemplation is suitable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">759</a></span>
the intelligence which still possesses reason; the second
is intelligence transported by love. Now, it is when
the nectar intoxicates <span class="locked">her,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></span> and deprives her of reason,
that the soul is transported with love, and that she
blossoms into a felicity that fulfils all her desires. It is
better for her to abandon herself to this intoxication
than to remain wise. In this state does intelligence
successively see one thing, and then another? No:
methods of instruction (or, constructive speech) give
out everything successively; but it is eternally that intelligence
possesses the power of thought, as well as
the power not to think; that is, to see the divinity
otherwise than by thought. Indeed, while contemplating
Him, she received within herself germs, she
felt them when they were produced and deposited
within her breast; when she sees them, she is said to
think; but when she sees the divinity, it is by that
superior power by virtue of which she was to think
later.</p>

<h3>THE SOUL DOES NOT THINK GOD, FOR IN THAT
CONDITION SHE DOES NOT THINK.</h3>

<p>As to the soul, she sees the divinity only by growing
confused, as it were by exhausting the intelligence
which resides in her; or rather, it is her first intelligence
that sees; but the vision the latter has of the divinity
reaches down to the soul, which then fuses with intelligence.
It is the Good, extending over intelligence
and the soul, and condescending to their level, which
spreads over them, and fuses them; hovering above
them, it bestows on them the happy vision, and the
ineffable feeling of itself. It raises them so high that
they are no more in any place, nor within anything
whatever, in any of the senses in which one thing is
said to be within another. For the Good is not within
anything; the intelligible location is within it, but it is
not in anything else. Then the soul moves no more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">760</a></span>
because the divinity is not in motion. To speak accurately,
she is no longer soul, because the divinity
does not live, but is above life; neither is she intelligence,
because the divinity is above intelligence; because
there must be complete assimilation (between
the soul and the divinity). Finally, the soul does not
think even the divinity, because in this condition she
does not think at all.</p>

<h3>THE TOUCH WITH THE GOOD IS THE GREATEST
OF SCIENCES.</h3>

<p>36. The remainder is plain. As to the last point,
it has already been discussed. Still it may be well to
add something thereto, starting from the point reached,
and proceeding by arguments. Knowledge, or, if it
may be so expressed, the "touch of the Good," is the
greatest thing in the world. <span class="locked">Plato<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></span> calls it the greatest
of sciences, and even so he here applies this designation
not to the vision itself of the Good, but to the
science of the Good that may be had before the vision.
This science is attained by the use of <span class="locked">analogies,<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></span> by
negations (made about the Good), by the knowledge
of things that proceed from it, and last by the degrees
that must be taken (or, upward steps that must be
climbed to reach up to <span class="locked">Him.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></span>) (These then are the
degrees) that lead up (to the divinity): purifications,
virtues that adorn the soul, elevation to the intelligible,
settling in the intelligible, and then the banquet at
which nectar feeds him who becomes simultaneously
spectator and spectacle, either for himself, or for
<span class="locked">others.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></span> Having become Being, Intelligence, and
universal living Organism, (the initiate) no longer
considers these things as being outside of him; having
arrived at that condition, she approaches Him who is
immediately above all the intelligible entities, and who
already sheds His radiance over them. (The initiate)
then leaves aside all the science that has led him till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">761</a></span>
there; settled in the beautiful, he thinks, so long as he
does not go beyond that (sphere of) being. But
there, as it were raised by the very flood of intelligence,
and carried away by the wave that swells, without
knowing how, he suddenly sees. The contemplation
which fills his eye with light does not reveal to him anything
exterior; it is the light itself that he sees. It is not
an opposition between light on one side, and the visible
object on the other; nor is there on one side intelligence,
and on the other the intelligible entity; there
is only the (radiation) which later begets these entities,
and permits them to exist within it. (The divinity) is no
more than the radiation that begets intelligence, begetting
without being consumed, and remaining within
itself. This radiation exists, and this existence alone
begets something else. If this radiation were not what
it was, neither would the latter thing subsist.</p>

<h3>GOD BEING ABOVE THOUGHT IGNORES EVERYTHING.</h3>

<p>37. They who attributed thought to the First
Principle have at least not attributed to Him the
thought of things that are inferior to Him, or which proceed
from <span class="locked">Him.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></span> Nevertheless some of them claimed
that it was absurd to believe that the divinity ignored
other things. As to the former, finding nothing greater
than the Good, they attributed to (the divinity) the
thought of <span class="locked">Himself,<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></span> as if this could add to His
majesty, as if even for Him, thinking were more than
being what He is, and it were not the Good Himself
which communicates His sublimity to intelligence. But
from whom then will the Good derive His greatness?
Would it come from thought, or from Himself? If He
derive it from thought, He is not great by himself; or at
least, He is no more sovereignly great. If it be from
Himself that He derives His greatness, He is perfectly
anterior to thought, and it is not thought that renders
Him perfect. Is He forced to think because He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">762</a></span>
actualization, and not merely potentiality? If He is
a being that ever thinks, and if this be the meaning of
<span class="locked">actualization,<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></span> we would be attributing to the Good
two things simultaneously: "being" and thought; instead
of conceiving of Him as a simple Principle, something
foreign is added to Him, as to eyes is added the
actualization of <span class="locked">sight,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></span> even admitting that they see
continually. (The divinity) is in actualization, in the
sense that He is both actualization and thought, is He
not? No, for being thought itself, He must not be
thinking, as movement itself does not <span class="locked">move.<a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></span> But
do not you yourselves say that (the divinity) is both
being and actualization? We think that being and
actualization are multiple and different things, whilst
the First is simple. To the principle that proceeds
from the First alone belongs thought, a certain seeking
out of its being, of itself, and of its origin. It deserves
the name of intelligence only by turning towards (the
First) in contemplation, and in knowing Him. As to
the unbegotten Principle, who has nothing above Him,
who is eternally what He is, what reason might He
have to think?</p>

<h3>THE FIRST PRINCIPLE HAS NO FUNCTION.</h3>

<p>That is why Plato rightly says that the Good is above
Intelligence. To speak of an "unthinking" intelligence
would be a self-contradiction; for the principle whose
nature it is to think necessarily ceases to be intelligent
if it does not think. But no function can be assigned
to a principle that has none, and we cannot blame it
for idleness because it does not fulfil some function;
this would be as silly as to reproach it for not possessing
the art of healing. To the first Principle then
should be assigned no function, because there is none
that would suit Him. He is (self) sufficient, and there
is nothing outside of Him who is above all; for, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">763</a></span>
being what He is, He suffices Himself and everything
else.</p>

<h3>OF THE FIRST PRINCIPLE WE MAY NOT EVEN SAY
THAT IT IS.</h3>

<p>38. Of the First we may not even say, "He is."
(He does not need this), since we do not either say
of Him, "He is good." "He is good" is said of the
same principle to which "He is" applies. Now "He is"
suits the (divinity) only on the condition that He be
given no attribute, limiting oneself to the assertion of
His existence. He is spoken of as the Good, not as
predicating an attribute or quality of Him, but to
indicate that He is the Good itself. We do not even
approve of this expression, "He is the Good," because
we think that not even the article should be prefixed
thereto; but inasmuch as our language would fail to
express an entire negation or deprivation, then, to
avoid introducing some diversity in it, we are forced to
name it, but there is no need to say "it is," we simply
call it, "the Good."</p>

<h3>THE SELF-SUFFICIENT GOOD DOES NOT NEED SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS
THEREOF.</h3>

<p>But how could we admit (the existence of) a nature
without feeling or consciousness of itself? We might
answer this, What consciousness of self can (the divinity)
have? Can He say, "I am?" But (in the above-mentioned
sense), He is not. Can He say, "I am the
Good"? Then He would still be saying of Himself
"I am" (whereas we have just explained that this He
cannot <span class="locked">do<a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></span>). What then will He add (to his simplicity)
by limiting Himself to saying, "The Good"?
For it is possible to think "the Good" apart from
"He is" so long as the Good is not, as an attribute,
applied to some other being. But whoever thinks himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">764</a></span>
good will surely say "I am the good"; if not, he
will think the predicate "good," but he will not be
enabled to think that he is so himself. Thus, the
thought of good will imply this thought, "I am the
good." If this thought itself be the Good, it will not
be the thought of Him, but of the good, and he will not
be the Good, but the <span class="locked">thought.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></span> If the thought of good
is different from the Good itself, the Good will be
prior to the thought of the good. If the Good be self-sufficient
before the thought, it suffices to itself to be
the Good; and in this respect has no need of the
thought that it is the Good.</p>

<h3>THE GOOD IS A SIMPLE PERCEPTION OF ITSELF;
A TOUCH.</h3>

<p>39. Consequently, the Good does not think itself
either as good, nor as anything else; for it possesses
nothing different from itself. It only has "a simple
perception of itself in respect to itself"; but as there is
no distance or difference in this perception it has of
itself, what could this perception be but itself? That
is why it perceives a difference where being and intelligence
appear. In order to think, intelligence must
admit identity and difference simultaneously. On the
one hand, without the relation between the Intelligible
and itself, the (mind) will not distinguish itself from
(the intelligible); and on the other, without the arising
of an "otherness" which would enable it to be everything,
it would not contemplate all (earthly) entities.
(Without this difference), intelligence would not even
be a "pair." Then, since intelligence thinks, if it
think really, it will not think itself alone, for why
should it not think all things? (Would it not do so)
because it was impotent to do so? In short, the principle
which thinks itself ceases to be simple, because
in thinking itself it must think itself as something different,
which is the necessary condition of thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">765</a></span>
<span class="locked">itself.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></span> We have already said that intelligence cannot
think itself without contemplating itself as something
different. Now in thinking, intelligence becomes
manifold (that is, fourfold): intelligible object (thing
thought) and intelligent subject (thinker); movement
(or, <span class="locked">moved<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></span>), and everything else that belongs to
intelligence. Besides, it must be noticed, as we have
pointed out elsewhere, that, to be thought, any
thought, must offer <span class="locked">variety<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></span>; but (in the divinity)
this movement is so simple and identical that it may
be compared to some sort of touch, and partakes in
nothing of intellectual actualization (therefore, thought
cannot be attributed to the divinity). What? Will
(the divinity) know neither others nor Himself, and
will He remain immovable in His majesty? (Surely).
All things are posterior to Him; He was what He is
before them. The thought of these things is adventitious,
changeable, and does not apply to permanent
objects. Even if it did apply to permanent objects,
it would still be multiple, for we could not grant that in
inferior beings thought was joined to being, while the
thoughts of intelligence would be empty notions. The
existence of Providence is sufficiently accounted for by
its being that from which proceed all (beings). How
then (in regard to all the beings that refer to Him)
could (the divinity) think them, since He does not
even think Himself, but remains immovable in His
majesty? That is why <span class="locked">Plato,<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></span> speaking of "being,"
says that it doubtless thinks, but that it does not remain
immovable in its majesty. By that he means that, no
doubt, "being" thinks, but that that which does not
think remains immovable in its majesty; using this expression
for lack of a better one. Thus Plato considers
the Principle which is superior to thought as possessing
more majesty, nay, sovereign majesty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">766</a></span></p>

<h3>THE FIRST PRINCIPLE HAS NO THOUGHT AS THE
FIRST ACTUALIZATION OF A HYPOSTASIS.</h3>

<p>40. That thought is incompatible with the first
Principle is something well known by all those who
have (in ecstasy) risen to <span class="locked">Him.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></span> To what we have
already said, we shall however add several arguments,
if indeed we succeed in expressing thought comprehensibly;
for conviction should be fortified by <span class="locked">demonstration.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></span>
In the first place, observe that all thought
exists within a subject, and proceeds from some object.
Thought that is connected with the object from which
it is derived, has the being to which it belongs, as
subject. It inheres in him because it is his actualization,
and completes his potentiality, without, itself,
producing anything; for it belongs exclusively to the
subject whose complement it is. Thought that is
hypostatically united with "being," and which underlies
its existence, could not inhere in the object from
which it proceeds; for, had it remained in him, it would
not have produced anything. Now, having the potentiality
of producing, it produced within itself; its actualization
was "being," and it was united thereto. Thus
thought is not something different from "being"; so
far as this nature thinks itself, it does not think itself
as being something different; for the only multiplicity
therein is that which results from the logical distinction
of intelligent subject (thinker) and intelligible object
(the being thought), as we have often pointed out.
That is the first actualization which produced a hypostasis
(or, form of existence), while constituting
"being"; and this actualization is the image of a Principle
so great that itself has become "being." If
thought belonged to the Good, instead of proceeding
therefrom, it would be no more than an attribute; it
would not, in itself, be a hypostatic form of existence.
Being the first actualization and the first thought, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">767</a></span>
thought has neither actualization nor thought above
it. Therefore, by rising above this "being" and this
thought, neither further "being" nor thought will
be met with; we would arrive to the Principle superior
to "being," and thought, an admirable principle,
which contains neither thought nor being,
which in solitary guise dwells within itself, and
which has no need of the things which proceed from
Him. He did not first act, and then produce an actualization
(he did not begin by thinking in order later
to produce thought); otherwise, he would have thought
before thought was born. In short, thought, being the
thought of good, is beneath Him, and consequently
does not belong to Him. I say: "does not belong to
Him," not denying that the Good can be thought (for
this, I admit); but because thought could not exist in
the Good; otherwise, the Good and that which is beneath
it&mdash;namely, the thought of Good&mdash;would fuse.
Now, if the good be something inferior, it will simultaneously
be thought and being; if, on the contrary,
good be superior to thought, it must likewise belong to
the <span class="locked">Intelligible.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></span></p>

<h3>EVEN IF THE GOOD THOUGHT, THERE WOULD BE
NEED OF SOMETHING SUPERIOR.</h3>

<p>Since therefore thought does not exist in the Good,
and since, on the contrary, it is inferior to the Good,
and since it must thus worship its majesty, (thought)
must constitute a different principle, and leaves the
Good pure and disengaged from it, as well as from
other things. Independent of thought, the Good is
what it is without admixture. The presence of the
Good does not hinder it from being pure and single.
If we were to suppose that Good is both thinking subject
and thought object (thinker and thought) or
"being," and thought connected with "being," if thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">768</a></span>
we make it think <span class="locked">itself,<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></span> it will need something else,
and thus things will be above it. As actualization and
thought are the complement or the consubstantial
hypostasis (or, form of existence) of another subject,
thought implies above it another nature to which it
owes the power of thinking; for thought cannot think
anything without something above it. When thought
knows itself, it knows what it received by the contemplation
of this other nature. As to Him who has
nothing above Him, who derives nothing from any
other principle, what could He think, and how could
He think himself? What would He seek, and what
would He desire? Would He desire to know the
greatness of His power? But by the mere fact of His
thinking it, it would have become external to Him; I
call it exterior, if the cognizing power within Him
differed from that which would be known; if on the
contrary they fuse, what would He seek?</p>

<h3>THOUGHT IS A HELP FOR SUB-DIVINE NATURES.</h3>

<p>41. It would seem that thought was only a help
granted to natures which, though divine, nevertheless
do not occupy the first rank; it is like an eye given to
the <span class="locked">blind.<a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></span> But what need would the eye have to see
essence, if itself were light? To seek light is the
characteristic of him who needs it, because he finds in
himself nothing but <span class="locked">darkness.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></span> Since thought seeks
light, while the light does not seek the light, the
primary Nature, not seeking the light (since it is light
itself), could not any more seek thought (since it is
thought that seeks light); thinking could not suit it,
therefore. What utility or advantage would thought
bring him, inasmuch as thought itself needs aid to
think? The Good therefore has not self-consciousness,
not having need thereof; it is not doubleness; or rather,
it is not double as is thought which implies (besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">769</a></span>
intelligence) a third term, namely, the intelligible
(world). If thought, the thinking subject (the thinker)
and the thought object (the thought) be absolutely
identical, they form but one, and are absolutely indistinguishable;
if they be distinct, they differ, and can
no more be the Good. Thus we must put everything
aside when we think of this "best Nature," which
stands in need of no assistance. Whatever you may
attribute to this Nature, you diminish it by that amount,
since it stands in need of nothing. For us, on the contrary,
thought is a beautiful thing, because our soul
has need of intelligence. It is similarly a beautiful
thing for intelligence, because thought is identical with
essence, and it is thought that gave existence to intelligence.</p>

<h3>THE GOOD IS NOT GOOD FOR ITSELF, BUT ONLY
FOR THE NATURES BELOW IT.</h3>

<p>Intelligence must therefore fuse with thought, and
must always be conscious of itself, knowing that each
of the two elements that constitute it is identical with
the other, and that both form but a single one. If it
were only unity, it would be self-sufficient, and would
have no further need of receiving anything. The precept
"know thyself" applies only to natures which,
because of their multiplicity, need to give an account
of themselves, to know the number and the quality of
their component elements, because they either do not
know them entirely, or even not at all; not knowing
what power in them occupies the first rank, and constitutes
their <span class="locked">being.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></span> But if there be a Principle which
is one by itself, it is too great to know itself, to think
itself, to be self-conscious, because it is nothing determinate
for itself. It receives nothing within itself,
sufficing itself. It is therefore the Good not for itself,
but for other natures; these indeed need the Good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">770</a></span>
but the Good has no need of itself; it would be ridiculous,
and would fail to stand up to itself. Nor does it
view itself; for, from this look something would arise,
or exist for Him. All such things He left to the inferior
natures, and nothing that exists in them is found in
Him; thus (the Good) is not even "being." Nor does
(the Good) possess thought, since thought is united
to being, and as primary and supreme thought coexisted
with essence. Therefore, one can not (as says
<span class="locked">Plato<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></span>), express (the divinity) by speech, nor have
perception nor science of Him, since no attribute can
be predicated of Him.</p>

<h3>THE BEAUTIFUL THE SUPREME OF THREE RANKS
OF EXISTENCE.</h3>

<p>42. When you are in doubt about this matter, and
when you wonder how you should classify these attributes
to which reasoning has brought you, reject
from among the things of the second order what seems
venerable; attribute to the First none of the things that
belong to the second order; neither attribute to those
of the second order (that is, to Intelligence), what
belongs to those of the third (that is, to the Soul);
but subsume under the first Principle the things of the
second order, and under the second principle the things
of the third. That is the true means of allowing each
being to preserve its nature, and at the same time to
point out the bond that connects the lower things with
the higher, and showing thus that the inferior things
depend on the superior ones, while the superior ones
remain in themselves. That is why (Plato) was right
in <span class="locked">saying,<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></span> "All things surround the King of all, and
exist on his account." "All things" means "all
beings." "All things exist on his account" means that
He is the cause of their existence, and the object of
their desire, because His nature is different from theirs,
because in Him is nothing that is in them, since they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">771</a></span>
could not exist if the First possessed some attribute of
what is inferior to Him. Therefore, if Intelligence be
comprised within what is meant by "all things," it
could not belong to the First. When (in the same
place Plato calls the divinity) "the cause of all beauty,"
he seems to classify beauty among the Ideas, and the
Good above the universal <span class="locked">beauty.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></span> After thus having
assigned the intelligible (entities) to the second rank,
he classifies, as dependent on them, the things of the
third order, which follow them. Last, to that which
occupies the third rank, to the universal Soul, he subsumes
the world that is derived therefrom. As the
Soul depends on the Intelligence, and as Intelligence
depends on the Good, all things thus depend from the
Good in different degrees, mediately or immediately.
In this respect, the things which are the most distant
from the Good are the objects of sense, which are
subsumed under the Soul.</p>

<span class="smaller">Of the Will of the One.</span></h2>

<h3 class="large">A. OF HUMAN FREE WILL.</h3>

<h3>DOES FREE WILL BELONG TO GOD ONLY, OR TO
OTHERS ONLY?</h3>

<p>1. Do the divinities themselves possess free will,
or is this limited to human beings, because of their
many weaknesses and uncertainties? (For we assume
that) the divinities possess omnipotence, so that it
would seem likely that their actions were free and
absolutely without petty restrictions. Or must we hold
that the (supreme) One alone possesses omnipotence,
and unhampered free will, while in other beings (free
will and opportunity) either ignore each other, or
conflict? We shall therefore have to determine the
nature of free will in first rank beings (the divinities)
and also the supreme Principle (the One), although
we acknowledge that both of them are omnipotent.
Besides, in respect to this omnipotence, we shall have
to distinguish possibility from actualization, present
or future.</p>

<h3>FREE WILL MUST BE FOR MEN, IF IT IS TO BE FOR
THE DIVINITIES.</h3>

<p>Before attacking these questions, we must, as is
usual, begin by examining whether we ourselves possess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774">774</a></span>
freedom of <span class="locked">will.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></span> First then, in what sense do we
possess free will (or, responsibility, "that something depends
on us"); or rather, what conception we should
form of it? To answer this question will be the only
means of arriving at a conclusion about whether or not
freedom of will should be ascribed to the divinities, let
alone (the supreme) Divinity. Besides, while attributing
to them freedom of will, we shall have to
inquire to what it applies, either in the other beings,
or in the Beings of the first rank.</p>

<h3>RESPONSIBILITY DEPENDS ON VOLUNTARINESS.</h3>

<p>What are our thoughts when we inquire whether
something depends on us? Under what circumstances
do we question this responsibility? We ask ourselves
whether we are anything, and whether really anything
depends on us when undergoing the buffets of fortune,
of necessity, of violent passions that dominate our
souls, till we consider ourselves mastered, enslaved, and
carried away by them? Therefore we consider as
dependent on ourselves what we do without the constraint
of circumstances, necessity, or violence of passions&mdash;that
is, voluntarily, and without an obstacle to
our <span class="locked">will.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></span> Hence the following definition: We are
responsible for that which depends on our will, which
happens or which is omitted according to our <span class="locked">volition.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></span>
We indeed call voluntary what we unconstrainedly do
and <span class="locked">consciously.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></span> On us depends only that of
which we are the masters to do or not to do. These
two notions are usually connected, though they differ
theoretically. There are cases when one of them is
lacking; one might, for instance, have the power to
commit a murder; and nevertheless if it were one's
own father that he had ignorantly killed, it would not
be a voluntary <span class="locked">act.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></span> In this case, the action was free,
but not voluntary. The voluntariness of an action depends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_775" id="Page_775">775</a></span>
on the knowledge, not only of the details, but
also of the total relations of the <span class="locked">act.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></span> Otherwise, why
should killing a friend, without knowing it, be called
a voluntary action? Would not the murder be equally
involuntary if one did not know that he was to commit
it? On the contrary hypothesis, it may be
answered that one had been responsible for providing
oneself with the necessary <span class="locked">information<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></span>; but nevertheless
it is not voluntarily that one is ignorant, or that
one was prevented from informing oneself about <span class="locked">it.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></span></p>

<h3>ON WHICH PSYCHOLOGICAL FACULTY IS THE
FREEDOM OF WILL BASED?</h3>

<p>2. But to which part of ourselves should we refer
free will? To appetite or desire, to anger or sex
passion, for instance? Or shall it be to the reason,
engaged in search after utility, and accompanied by
desire? If to anger or sex <span class="locked">passion,<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></span> we should be
supposed to grant freedom of will to brutes, to children,
to the angry, to the insane, to those misled by magic
charms, or suggestions of the imagination, though
none of such persons be master of himself? If again
(we are to ascribe freedom of will) to reason accompanied
by desire, does this mean to reason even when
misled, or only to right reason, and right desire?<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>
One might even ask whether reason be moved by desire,
or desire by <span class="locked">reason.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></span> For, admitting that desires
arise naturally, a distinction will nevertheless have to
be established: if they belong to the animal part, and to
the combination (of soul and body), the soul will
obey the necessity of nature; if they belong to the
soul alone, many things which are generally attributed
to the domain of our free will will have to be withdrawn
therefrom. Besides, passions are always preceded
by some sort of abstract reasoning. Further,
how can imagination itself&mdash;which constrains us; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">776</a></span>
desire&mdash;which drags us whither Necessity compels,
make us "masters of <span class="locked">ourselves"<a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></span> under these circumstances?
Besides, how can we be "masters of ourselves"
in general when we are carried away? That
faculty of ours which necessarily seeks to satisfy its
needs, is not mistress of the things towards which it is
compelled to <span class="locked">move.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></span> How should we attribute freedom
of will to (a soul) that depends on something
else? (To a soul) which, in this thing, holds the
principle of her own determinations? (To a soul)
that regulates her life thereby, and derives therefrom
her nature? (To a soul) that lives according to the
instructions received therefrom? Freedom of will
would then have to be acknowledged even in inanimate
things; for even fire acts according to its inborn
nature.</p>

<h3>PRELIMINARY KNOWLEDGE DOES NOT SETTLE
THE LIBERTARIAN PROBLEM.</h3>

<p>Some person might try to establish a distinction
founded on the fact that the animal and the soul do
not act unconsciously. If they know it by mere sensation,
how far does that sensation contribute to the
freedom of will? For sensation, limiting itself to perception,
does not yield the percipient mastery over
<span class="locked">anything.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></span> If they know it by knowledge, and if
this knowledge contain only the accomplished fact,
their actions are then determined by some other principle.
If, even independently of desire, reason or
knowledge make us perform certain actions, or dominate
<span class="locked">us,<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></span> to what faculty shall the action be ascribed,
and how does it occur? If reason produce another
desire, how does it do so? If reason manifest itself
and liberate us by the process of calming our desires,
the free will lies no longer in the action, but in intelligence;
for every action, however much directed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_777" id="Page_777">777</a></span>
reason, would then be something mixed, not revealing
an unconfused free will.</p>

<h3>LIBERTY REFERRED TO THE ACTION OF
INTELLIGENCE.</h3>

<p>3. The question must be examined carefully, for it
will later be applied to the divinities. Responsibility
has been traced to the will, and this to reason first,
and later to right reason. Better, to reason enlightened
by knowledge; for freedom of will is not possessed
incontestably if one be ignorant of why his decision
or action is good, if one have been led to do the right
thing by chance, or by some sensible representation.
Since the latter is not within our power, we could not
impute to free will the actions it inspired. By "sensible
representation," or, <span class="locked">"phantasy,"<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></span> we mean the imagination
excited within us by the passions of the body;
for it offers us different images according as the body
has need of food, of drink, or of sensual pleasures.
Those who act according to the "sensible representations"
excited within them by divers qualities of the
humors of the body are not wholly responsible for
their actions. That is why depraved men, who usually
act according to these images, do not, according to
us, perform actions that are free and voluntary. We
ascribe free will only to him who, enfranchised from
the passions of the body, performs actions determined
solely by intelligence. We refer liberty, therefore, to
the noblest principle, to the action of the <span class="locked">intelligence<a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></span>;
we regard as free only the decisions whose principle it
is, and as voluntary, only the desires it inspires. This
freedom is that which we ascribe to the divinities, who
live in conformity with Intelligence, and with the Desire
of which it is the principle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778">778</a></span>183</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE HAS CONVERSION TO GOOD AND
"BEING IN ITSELF."</h3>

<p>4. We might ask how that which is produced by
a desire could be autocratically free, since the desire
implies a need, and drags us towards something exterior;
for whoever desires really yields to an inclination,
even though the latter should lead him to the
Good. We might further ask whether intelligence,
doing that which is in its nature to do, in a manner
conformable to its nature, is free and independent,
since it could have done the opposite. Further, we
may ask whether we have the right to attribute free
will to that which does not do any deeds; last, whether
that which does a deed, is not, by the mere fact that
every action has a purpose, subject to an external
necessity. How indeed could one attribute freedom to
a being that obeys its nature?</p>

<p>We (might answer), how can one say of this being
that it obeys, if it be not constrained to follow something
external? How would the being that directs
itself towards the Good be constrained, if its desire be
voluntary, if it direct itself towards the Good, knowing
that it is such? Only involuntarily does a being
depart from the Good, only by constraint does it direct
itself towards that which is not its good; that is the
very nature of servitude, not to be able to reach one's
own good, and to be thwarted by a superior power
to which obedience is compulsory. Servitude displeases
us, not because it deprives us of the liberty to
do evil, but because it hinders us going towards our
own, from ensuing our own good, forced as we are
to work at the good of someone else. When we speak
of "obeying our nature," we distinguish (in the being
that obeys its nature) two principles, the one which
commands, and the other which <span class="locked">obeys.<a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_779" id="Page_779">779</a></span>
But when a principle has a simple nature, when it is
a single actualization, when it is not other in potentiality
than it is in actualization, how would it not be
free? It cannot be said to be acting conformably to its
nature, because its actualization is not different from
its being, and because, within it, essence and action
coincide. It surely is free, if it act neither for another,
nor in dependence on another. If the word "independent"
be not suitable here, if it be too weak, we
must at least understand that this Principle does not
depend on any other, does not recognize it as the ruler
of its actions, any more than of its being, since it itself
is principle.</p>

<p>Indeed, if Intelligence depend upon a further principle,
at least this one is not external, but is the Good
itself. If then it be in the Good itself that it finds its
welfare, so much the more does it itself possess independence
and liberty, since it seeks them only in view
of the Good. When therefore Intelligence acts in conformity
with the Good, it has a higher degree of independence;
for it possesses already the "conversion to
the Good," inasmuch as it proceeds from the Good,
and the privilege of being in itself, because Intelligence
is turned towards the Good; now it is better for Intelligence
to remain within itself, since it is thus turned
towards the Good.</p>

<h3>FREEDOM OF WILL AND VIRTUE ARE INDEPENDENT
OF THE ACTIONS.</h3>

<p>5. Do autocratic freedom and independence inhere
in pure and thinking Intelligence exclusively, or are
they also found in the soul which applies its contemplative
activity to intelligence, and its practical activity
to virtue? If we grant liberty to the practical activity
of the soul, we will not extend it to its results; for
of this we are not always masters. But if liberty is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_780" id="Page_780">780</a></span>
attributed to the soul which does good, and which, in
everything acts by herself, we are near the truth.</p>

<p>How would that depend on us? As it depends on
us to be courageous when there is a war. Nevertheless,
admitting that it then depends on us to be
courageous, I observe that, if there were no war,
we could not perform any action of this nature.
Likewise, in all other virtuous deeds, virtue always
depends on accidental circumstances which force us to
do some particular <span class="locked">thing.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></span> Now if we were to give
virtue the liberty of deciding whether it desired a war,
so as to be able to offer a proof of courage; or desired
injustices, as opportunities to define and to respect
rights; or wished that people might be poor to be able
to show forth its liberality; or whether it preferred to
remain at rest, because everything was in order; might
virtue not prefer to remain inactive in case nobody
needed her <span class="locked">services.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></span> Similarly a good physician,
such as Hippocrates, for instance, would wish that his
professional services should not be needed by anybody.
If then virtue when applied to actions be forced to
engage in such activities, how could it possess independence
in all its purity? Should we not say that
actions are subject to Necessity, whilst the preliminary
volition and reasoning are independent? If this be
so, and since we locate free will in that which precedes
its execution, we shall also have to locate autocratic
freedom and independence of virtue outside of the
(actual) deed.</p>

<h3>VIRTUE AS INTELLECTUALIZING HABIT LIBERATES
THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>What shall we now say of virtue considered as
"habit" or disposition? Does it not occupy itself with
regulating and moderating the passions and desires
when the soul is not healthy? In what sense do we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_781" id="Page_781">781</a></span>
then say that it depends on us to be good, and that
"virtue has no master?"<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> In this sense, that it is we
who will and choose; more, in the sense that virtue, by
its assistance, yields us liberty and independence, and
releases us from servitude. If then virtue be another
kind of intelligence, "a habit that intellectualizes the
soul," even in this respect must liberty be sought not
in practical activity, but in the intelligence divorced
from activity.</p>

<h3>LIBERTY REFERS TO THE INTERIOR LIFE, RATHER
THAN TO THE EXTERIOR.</h3>

<p>6. How then did we previously refer liberty to
volition, saying that "that which depends on us, our
responsibility, is that which occurs according to our
will"? Yes, but we added, "or does not occur." If
indeed we be right, and if we continue to support our
former opinion, we shall have to recognize that virtue
and intelligence are their own mistresses, and that it is
to them that we must refer our free will and independence.
Since they have no master, we shall admit that
(our) intelligence remains within itself, that virtue
must equally remain calm in itself, regulating the soul
so as to make her good, and that in this respect it
itself is both free, and enfranchises the soul. If passions
or necessary actions arise, (virtue) directs them
automatically; nevertheless she still preserves her independence
(or, freedom) by getting into relations
with everything. For instance, (virtue) does not
engage in exterior things to save the body in times of
danger; on the contrary, she abandons it, if it seem
advisable; she orders the man to renounce even life,
wealth, children, and fatherland; for her object is to
be honorable, relinquishing anything beneath her
dignity. This evidently shows that our liberty of action
and independence do not refer to practical matters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_782" id="Page_782">782</a></span>
nor to external occupations, but to interior activity, to
thought, to the contemplation of virtue itself. This
virtue must be considered as a kind of intelligence, and
must not be confused with the passions that dominate
and govern reason; for these, as (Plato<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a>) says, seem
to derive something from the body, though trained by
exercise and habit.</p>

<h3>LIBERTY DEPENDS ON THE HIGHEST INTELLIGENCE.</h3>

<p>Liberty therefore belongs to the immaterial principle,
and to this should be traced our free will. This
principle is the volition which rules itself, and which
remains within itself; even when by necessity compelled
to take some resolution affecting external affairs.
All that proceeds from (the immaterial principle)
and exists by it, depends on us, and is free;
what is outside of it, and with it; what it itself wills and
carries out unhindered, also constitutes what primarily
depends on us. The contemplative and primary Intelligence
therefore possesses independence, because in
the accomplishment of its function it depends on no
other being, because fulfilling (its function, Intelligence)
remains entirely turned towards itself, exclusively
engaged with itself, resting in the Good, living
according to its will, satisfied, and without needs. Besides,
will is nothing more than thought; but it was
called "will" because it was conformed to intelligence;
for will imitates what conforms to intelligence. On
the one hand, will desires the Good; on the other,
for Intelligence to think truly, is to abide within the
Good. Intelligence therefore possesses what the will
desires, and, in attaining these its desires, will becomes
thought. Since, therefore, we define liberty as
the will's achievement of the Good, why should not
liberty also be predicated of the Intelligence which is
founded on (the Good) that is the object of the desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783">783</a></span>
of our will? If, however, there should still be objection
to ascribing liberty to intelligence, this could be
the case only by ascribing it to something still higher
(namely, super-Intelligence).</p>

<h3>THE SOUL IS FREE BY INTELLIGENCE, WHICH IS
FREE BY ITSELF.</h3>

<p>7. The soul therefore becomes free when, by the
aid of intelligence, she defies all obstacles in her ascent
to the Good; and whatever she does for the sake of
the Good is responsible action. Intelligence, however,
is free by itself.</p>

<h3 class="large">B. OF THE FREE WILL OF THE SUPREME.</h3>

<p class="in0 center">(<i>Let us now consider the free will of the Good.</i>)</p>

<h3>THE GOOD IS THE DESIRABLE IN ITSELF.</h3>

<p>8. The nature of the Good is that which is desirable
for its own sake. It is by the Good that the
Soul and Intelligence exercise liberty when the Soul
can attain the Good without obstacle, and when Intelligence
can enjoy its possession. Now since the
Good's empire extends over all lower treasures; since
He occupies the front rank; since He is the Principle
to which all beings wish to rise, on whom they all
depend, and from whom all derive their power and
liberty; it would be difficult to attribute to Him a
liberty similar to our human freedom of will, when
we can hardly, with propriety, predicate such a human
liberty of Intelligence.</p>

<h3>THE GOOD IS FREE, BUT NOT MERELY BY CHANCE.</h3>

<p>Here some rash <span class="locked">person,<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></span> drawing his arguments
from some other school of thought, may object that,
"If the Good be indeed good, this occurs only by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">784</a></span>
chance. A man is not master of what he is (that is,
of his own nature), because his own nature does not
depend on himself (that is, is not due to self-determination).
Consequently, he enjoys neither freedom nor
independence, as he acts or withholds action as he is
forced by necessity." Such an assertion is gratuitous,
and even self-contradictory. It destroys all conception
of will, liberty and independence, reducing these terms
to being labels, and illusions. He who advances such
an opinion is forced to maintain not only that it is not
within the power of anybody to do or not to do some
thing, but also that the word "liberty" arouses no
conception in his mind, and is meaningless. If however
he insist that he does understand it, he will soon
be forced to acknowledge that the conception of liberty
bears a conformity with the reality which he at first
denied. The conception of a thing exerts no interference
on its substance ("being"); it can do nothing
by itself, nor can it lead to hypostatic existence. It
is limited to pointing out to us which being obeys
others, which being possesses free will, which being
depends on no other, but is master of its own action,
a privilege characteristic of eternal beings so far as
they are eternal, or to beings which attain the Good
without obstacle (like the Soul), or possess it (like
Intelligence). It is therefore absurd to say that the
Good, which is above them, seeks other higher good
beyond itself.</p>

<h3>BEING AND ACTUALIZATION CONSTITUTE ONE
SELF-EXISTENT PRINCIPLE.</h3>

<p>Nor is it any more accurate to insist that the Good
exists by chance. Chance occurs only in the lower
and multiple things. We on the contrary insist that the
First does not exist by chance, and that one cannot
say that He is not master of His birth, since He was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_785" id="Page_785">785</a></span>
<span class="locked">born.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></span> It is not any less absurd to assert that He is
not free because He acts according to His nature; for
such an assertion would seem to imply that freedom
consists in actions contrary to one's nature. Last,
His solitariness (or, unity) does not deprive Him of
liberty, because this unity does not result from His
being hindered by anybody else (from having anything
else), but from His being what He is, from His satisfying
(or, pleasing) Himself, as He could not be any
better; otherwise, it would be implied that one would
lose one's liberty on attaining the Good. If such an
assertion be absurd, is it not the summit of absurdity
to refuse to predicate autocratic liberty of the Good
because of His being good, because He remains within
Himself and because since all beings aspire towards
Him, He Himself aspires to nothing else than Himself,
and has no need of anything? As His higher hypostatic
existence is simultaneously His higher actualization&mdash;for
in Him these two aspects fuse into one, since they
do so even in Intelligence&mdash;His essence is no more
conformed to His actualization, than His actualization
to His essence. He cannot be said to actualize according
to His nature, nor that His actualization and His
higher life are traced up into His higher being (so to
speak). But as His higher being and His higher
(actualization) are intimately united, and coexist since
all eternity, the result is that these two entities constitute
a single Principle, which depends on itself, and
nothing else.</p>

<h3>PHYSICAL QUALITIES USED OF THE SUPREME ONLY
BY ANALOGY.</h3>

<p>8. We conceive of the self-rule as no accident of
the Good; but, from the self-rule proper to (all)
beings, we rise, by abstraction of the contraries, to Him
who Himself is liberty and independence, thus applying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_786" id="Page_786">786</a></span>
to this Principle the lower attributes that we borrow
from inferior beings (that is, the Soul and Intelligence),
because of our impotence to speak properly of Him.
Such indeed are the terms that we could use in referring
to Him, though it would be absolutely impossible
to find the proper expression, not only to predicate
anything of Him, but even to say anything whatever
about Him. For the most beautiful and venerable
things do no more than imitate Him, who is their
principle. Nevertheless, from another standpoint, He
is not their principle, since this their imitation must be
denied, and we must withdraw, as too inferior, even
the terms "liberty" and "self-rule," for these terms
seem to imply a tendency towards something else,
an obstacle, even if only to avoid it; the coexistence
of other beings, even if only to imitate Him uninterruptedly.
Now no tendency should be attributed to
the Good. He is what He is before all other things,
since we do not even say of Him, "He is," so as not
to establish any connection between Him and "beings."
Neither can we say of Him, "according to His nature";
for this expression indicates some later relation. It
is indeed applied to intelligible entities, but only so far
as they proceed from some other principle; that is why
it is applied to "being," because it is born of the
(Good). But if we refer "nature" to temporal things,
it could not be predicated of "being"; for to say that
"being" does not exist by itself would be to affect its
existence; to say that it derives its existence from
something else is equivalent to asserting that it does
not exist by itself. Nor should we say of the Good
that "His nature is accidental," nor speak of contingency
in connection with (the Divinity); for He is contingent
neither for Himself nor for other beings; contingency
is found only in the multiple beings which,
already being one thing, have accidentally become
some other. How indeed could the First exist accidentally?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787">787</a></span>
for He did not reach His present condition
fortuitously enough to enable us even to ask, "How
did He become what He is?" No chance led Him (to
become His present self), nor led Him to hypostatic
existence; for chance and luck did not exist anteriorly
to Him, since even they proceed from a cause, and
exist only in things that <span class="locked">grow<a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></span> (or, "become").</p>

<h3>"CONTINGENCE" MIGHT BE APPLIED TO THE SUPREME,
IF THE WORD BE RE-DEFINED.</h3>

<p>9. If however anybody applied the term "contingency"
to the Divinity, we should not dispute about
the word, but go back of it to its underlying meaning.
Do you, by it, mean that the First is a principle of particular
nature and power; and that if He had had a
different nature, He would still, as principle, have
conformed to the nature He would have had? Also,
that if He had been less perfect, He would still have
actualized in conformity with His being? We should
answer such an assertion thus: it was impossible for
the higher Principle of all things to be contingent; or
to be less perfect accidentally, or good in some other
manner, as some higher thing that was less complete.
As the principle of all things must be better than they,
He must be determinate; and by this is here meant that
He exists in an unique manner. This, however, not by
necessity; for necessity did not exist before Him.
Necessity exists only in the beings that follow the first
Principle, though the latter impose no constraint upon
them. It is by Himself that the First exists uniquely.
He could not be anything but what He is; He is what
He ought to have been; and not by accident. He is
that; He had to be what He was. So "He who is what
He ought to have been" is the principle of the things
that ought to exist. Not by accident, nor contingently,
therefore, is He what He is; He is what He had to be;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_788" id="Page_788">788</a></span>
though here the term "had to be" is improper. (If
we be permitted to explain what we mean by an illustration,
we may say that) the other beings have to
await the appearance of their king&mdash;which means, that
He shall posit Himself as what He really is, the true
King, the true Principle, the true Good. Of Him it
must not even be said that He actualizes in conformity
with the Good, for then He would seem subordinate to
some other principle; we must say only that He is
what He is. He is not conformed to the Good, because
He is the Good itself.</p>

<h3>NOT EVEN ESSENCE IS CONTINGENT, LET ALONE
SUPER-ESSENCE.</h3>

<p>Besides, there is nothing contingent, even in (that
which is beneath the First), namely, Essence-in-itself;
for if any contingency inhered in it, it itself would be
contingent. But Essence cannot be contingent, for
not fortuitously is it what it is; nor does it derive what
it is from anything else, because the very nature of
Essence is to be Essence. This being the case, how
could "He who is above Essence" be considered as
being what He is fortuitously? For He begat Essence,
and Essence is not what it is fortuitously, since it exists
in the same manner as "Being," which is what is
"Being" and Intelligence&mdash;otherwise, one might even
say that Intelligence was contingent, as if it could have
been anything but what is its nature. Thus He who
does not issue from Himself, and does not incline towards
anything whatever, is what He is in the most
special sense.</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME IS THE POWER REALLY MASTER
OF HIMSELF.</h3>

<p>What now could be said (to look down) from some
(peak) overhanging (Essence and Intelligence), upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_789" id="Page_789">789</a></span>
(their principle)? Could you describe what you saw
from there as being what it is fortuitously? Certainly
not! Neither His nature nor His manner would be
contingent. He is merely (an absolute, unexplainable)
existence (a "thus"). Even this term "thus," however,
would be improper, for, on applying it to the
First, it would become determinate, and become "such
a thing." Whoever has seen the First would not say
He was, or was not that; otherwise, you would be
reducing Him to the class of things which may be
designated as this or that; but the First is above all
these things. When you shall have seen Him who is
infinite ("indefinite"), you will be able to name all
the things that are after Him (you will be able to
name Him whom all things follow); but you must
not classify Him among these. Consider Him as the
universal Power essentially master (of himself), which
is what He wishes; or rather, who has imposed His
will upon (all) beings, but who Himself is greater than
all volition, and who classifies volition as below Himself.
(To speak strictly therefore) He did not even
will to be what He is (he did not even say, I shall be
that); and no other principle made Him be what He is.</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME BANISHES ALL CHANCE BY ASSIGNING
LIMIT AND SHAPE TO EACH FORM.</h3>

<p>10. He (Strato the Peripatetic?) who insists that
the Good is what it is by chance, should be asked how
he would like to have it demonstrated to him that the
hypothesis of chance is false&mdash;in case it be false&mdash;and
how chance could be made to disappear from the universe?
If there be a nature (such as the nature of the
one Unity), which makes (chance) disappear, it itself
could not be subject to chance. If we subject to
chance the nature which causes other beings not
to be what they are by chance, nothing will be left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_790" id="Page_790">790</a></span>
that could have been derived from chance. But the
principle of all beings banishes chance from the universe
by giving to each (being) a form, a limitation,
and a shape; and it is impossible to attribute to chance
the production of beings thus begotten in a manner
conforming to reason. A cause exists there. Chance
reigns only in things that do not result from a plan,
which are not concatenated, which are accidental.
How indeed could we attribute to chance the existence
of the principle of all reason, order, and determination?
Chance no doubt sways many <span class="locked">things<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></span>; but it could not
control the production of intelligence, reason, and
order. Chance, in fact, is the contrary of reason; how
then could (chance) produce (reason)? If chance
do not beget Intelligence, so much the more could it
not have begotten the still superior and better Principle;
for chance had no resources from which to produce
this principle; chance itself did not exist; and it
would not have been in any manner able to impart
eternal (qualities). Thus, since there is nothing anterior
to the (Divinity), and as He is the First, we
shall have to halt our inquiry about this Principle, and
say nothing more about Him, rather examining the
production of the beings posterior to Him. As to Him
himself, there is no use considering how He was produced,
as He really was not produced.</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME AS MASTER OF HIS OWN BEING.</h3>

<p>Since He was not produced, we must suppose that
He is the master of His own being. Even if He were
not master of His own being, and if, being what He is,
He did not endow Himself with "hypostatic" form of
existence, and limited Himself to utilizing His resources,
the consequence is that He is what He is necessarily,
and that He could not have been different from what
He is. He is what He is, not because He could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_791" id="Page_791">791</a></span>
been otherwise, but because His nature is excellent.
Indeed, even if one be sometimes hindered from becoming
better, no one is ever hindered by any other
person from becoming worse. Therefore, if He did
not issue from Himself, He owes it to Himself, and not
to any outside hindrance; He must essentially be that
which has not issued from itself. The impossibility of
becoming worse is not a mark of impotence, because,
if (the Divinity) do not degenerate, He owes it to
Himself, (and derives it) from Himself. His not aspiring
to anything other than Himself constitutes the
highest degree of power, since He is not subjected to
necessity, but constitutes the law and necessity of other
beings. Has necessity then caused its own (hypostatic)
existence? No, it has not even reached there,
inasmuch as all that is after the First achieved (hypostatic)
existence on His account. How then could He
who is before (hypostatic) existence (or, which has
achieved a form of existence), have derived His existence
from any other principle, or even from Himself?</p>

<h3>IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TRANSCEND THE FIRST.</h3>

<p>11. What then is the Principle which one cannot
even say that it is (hypostatically) existent? This
point will have to be conceded without discussion,
however, for we cannot prosecute this inquiry. What
indeed would we be seeking, when it is impossible to
go beyond, every inquiry leading to some one principle,
and ceasing there? Besides, all questions refer to one
of four things: existence, quality, cause and essence.
From the beings that follow Him, we conclude to the
essence of the First, in that sense in which we say He
exists. Seeking the cause of His existence, however,
would amount to seeking an (ulterior) principle, and
the Principle of all things cannot Himself have a principle.
An effort to determine His quality would
amount to seeking what accident inheres in Him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_792" id="Page_792">792</a></span>
whom is nothing contingent; and there is still more
clearly no possible inquiry as to His existence, as we
have to grasp it the best we know how, striving not
to attribute anything to Him.</p>

<h3>THE ORIGIN OF GOD PUZZLES US ONLY BECAUSE WE
HABITUALLY START FROM SOME PRE-EXISTENT
CHAOS.</h3>

<p>(Habitually) we are led to ask these questions about
the nature (of the divinity) chiefly because we conceive
of space and location as a chaos, into which
space and location, that is either presented to us by
our imagination, or that really exists, we later introduce
the first Principle. This introduction amounts to
a question whence and how He came. We then treat
Him as a stranger, and we wonder why He is present
there, and what is His being; we usually assume He
came up out of an abyss, or that He fell from above.
In order to evade these questions, therefore, we shall
have to remove from our conception (of the divinity)
all notion of locality, and not posit Him within anything,
neither conceiving of Him as eternally resting,
and founded within Himself, nor as if come from
somewhere. We shall have to content ourselves with
thinking that He exists in the sense in which reasoning
forces us to admit His existence, or with persuading
ourselves that location, like everything else, is posterior
to the Divinity, and that it is even posterior to all
things. Thus conceiving (of the Divinity) as outside
of all place, so far as we can conceive of Him, we are
not surrounding Him as it were within a circle, nor are
we undertaking to measure His greatness, nor are we
attributing to Him either quantity or quality; for He
has no shape, not even an intelligible one; He is not
relative to anything, since His hypostatic form of existence
is contained within Himself, and before all else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_793" id="Page_793">793</a></span></p>

<h3>THE SUPREME, BEING WHAT HE IS, IS NOT
PRODUCED BY CHANCE.</h3>

<p>Since (the Divinity) is such, we certainly could not
say that He is what He is by chance. Such an assertion
about Him is impossible, inasmuch as we can speak of
Him only by <span class="locked">negations.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></span> We shall therefore have to
say, not that He is what He is by chance; but that,
being what He is, He is not that by chance, since there
is within Him absolutely nothing contingent.</p>

<h3>EVEN WE MAY BE SAID TO BE MASTERS OF OURSELVES;
HOW MUCH MORE THE SUPREME!</h3>

<p>12. Shall we not even refuse to say that (the
divinity) is what He is, and is the master of what He
is, or of that which is still superior? Our soul still
moots this problem, because she is not yet entirely
convinced by what we have said. Our considerations
thereof are as follows. By his body, each one of us
is far separated from "being"; but by his soul, by
which he is principally constituted, he participates in
"being," and is a certain being; that is, he is a combination
of "difference" and "being." Fundamentally,
we are therefore not a "being"; we are not even
"being"; consequently, we are not masters of our
"being"; "being" itself rather is master of us, since
it furnishes us with "difference" (which, joined with
"being," constitutes our nature). As, in a certain degree,
we are nevertheless the "being" that is master
of us, we may, in this respect, even here below, be
called masters of ourselves. As to the Principle which
absolutely is what He is, which is "Being" itself, so
that He and His being fuse, He is master of Himself,
and depends on nothing, either in His existence or
"being." He does not even need to be master of
Himself since (He is being), and since all that occupies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_794" id="Page_794">794</a></span>
the first rank in the intelligible world is classified
as "being."</p>

<h3>HOW THE SUPREME IS EVEN BEYOND HIS OWN
MASTER.</h3>

<p>As to Him who made "being" (equivalent to) freedom,
whose nature it is to make free beings, and who
(therefore) might be called the "author of liberty"&mdash;excuse
the expression&mdash;to what could He be enslaved?
It is His being (or, nature) to be free; or rather, it is
from Him that being derives its freedom; for (we must
not forget that) "being" is posterior to Him, who
Himself (being beyond it), "has" none. If then there
be any actualization in Him, if we were to consider
that He was constituted by an actualization, He would
nevertheless contain no difference, He will be master
of His own self that produces the actualization, because
He Himself and the actualization fuse (and are
identical). But if we acknowledge no actualization
whatever (in the Divinity), if we predicate actualization
only of the things that tend towards Him, and
from Him derive their hypostatic existence, we should
still less recognize in Him any element that is master,
or that masters. We should not even say that He was
master of Himself, nor that He had a master, but because
we have already predicated of "being" what is
meant by being master of oneself. We therefore
classify (the Divinity) in a rank higher still.</p>

<p>But how can there be a principle higher than the
one that is master of Himself? In the Principle which
is master of Himself, as being and actualization are
two (separate) entities, it is actualization that furnishes
the notion of being master of oneself. As however we
saw that actualization was identical with "being," in
order to be called master of itself, actualization must
have differentiated itself from being. Therefore (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_795" id="Page_795">795</a></span>
Divinity), which is not constituted by two things fused
into unity, but by absolute Unity, being either only
actualization, or not even mere actualization, could
not be called "master of Himself."</p>

<h3>ALL SUCH LANGUAGE ABOUT THE DIVINITY IS
METAPHORICAL.</h3>

<p>13. Although the above expressions, when applied
to the (divinity), are really not exact, we are nevertheless
forced to use them in connection with this disquisition.
We therefore repeat what was above rightly
stated, that no doubleness, not even if merely logical,
should be admitted to our idea of the Divinity. Nevertheless,
that we may be better understood, we shall
for a moment lay aside the strictness of language demanded
by reason.</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME IS MASTER OF HIMSELF BECAUSE
HIS VERY ESSENCE DEPENDS ON HIMSELF.</h3>

<p>Now supposing the existence of actualizations in the
divinity, and that these actualizations depend on His
will&mdash;for he could not actualize involuntarily&mdash;and
that simultaneously they constitute His being; in this
case, His will and His being will be identical (that is,
will fuse). Such as He wished to be, He is. That He
wills and actualizes in conformity to His nature, will
not be said in preference to this, that His being conforms
to His will and His actualization. He is absolutely
master of Himself, because His very essence
depends on Himself.</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME IS A UNITY OF WILL, BEING AND
ACTUALIZATION.</h3>

<p>Here arises another consideration. Every being,
that aspires to the Good, wishes to be the Good far
more than to be what it is; and thinks itself as existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_796" id="Page_796">796</a></span>
most, the more it participates in the Good. Its preference
is to be in such a state, to participate in the Good
as much as possible, because the nature of the Good is
doubtless preferable in itself. The greater the portion
of good possessed by a being, the freer and more conformable
to its will is its nature (being); then it forms
but one and the same thing with its will, and by its
will achieves hypostatic existence (or, a form of existence).
So long as a being does not possess the Good,
it wishes to be different from what it is; so soon as the
being possesses it, the being wishes to be what it is.
This union, or presence of the Good in a being, is not
fortuitous; its "being" is not outside of the Will (of
the Good); by this presence of the Good it is determined,
and on that account, belongs to itself. If
then this presence of the Good cause every being to
make and determine itself, then evidently (the Divinity)
is primarily and particularly the principle through
which the rest may be itself. The "being" (of the
Good) is intimately united with the will (the Divinity)
has to be such as He is&mdash;if I may be permitted to speak
thus&mdash;and He cannot be understood unless He wishes
to be what He is. As in Him everything concurs (in a
consummation), He wishes to be, and is what He
wishes; His will and Himself form but one (are identical,
or, fuse). He is not any the less one, for He
finds that He is precisely what He may have wished to
be. What indeed could He have wished to be, if not
what He is?</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME WOULD WISH TO BE WHAT HE IS.</h3>

<p>Now supposing that (the divinity) were given the
chance to choose what He would like to be, and that
He were permitted to change His nature, He would
not desire to become different from what He is; He
would not find in Himself anything that displeased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_797" id="Page_797">797</a></span>
Him, as if He had been forced to be what He is; for He
as ever willed, and still wills to be what He is. The
nature of Good is really His will; He has neither yielded
to a lure, nor (blindly) followed his own nature, but
He preferred Himself, because there was nothing different
that He could have wished to be. With this,
contrast that other beings do not find implied in their
own being the reason of pleasing themselves, and that
some of them are even dissatisfied with themselves.
In the hypostatic existence of the Good, however, is
necessarily contained self-choice, and self-desire; otherwise,
there would be nothing in the whole universe that
could please itself, since one pleases himself only inasmuch
as he participates in the Good, and possesses an
image of it within oneself.</p>

<h3>EVERY TERM, WHEN APPLIED TO THE DIVINITY,
SHOULD BE PRECEDED BY A PARTICLE REMINDING
IT IS ONLY USED METAPHORICALLY.</h3>

<p>We must, however, ask indulgence for our language;
when speaking of the (divinity) we are, by the necessity
of being understood, obliged to make use of words
which a meticulous accuracy would question. Each
of them should be prefixed by a (warning) particle,
(meaning "somewhat," or) "higher."</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME IS CHOICE, BEING, WILL, SELF-DIRECTION,
AND SELF-EXISTENCE.</h3>

<p>The subsistence of the Good implies that of choice
and will, because He could not exist without these two.
But (in the Divinity) (these three, choice, being and
will) do not form a multiplicity; they must be considered
as having fused. Since He is the author of will,
He must evidently also be the author of what is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_798" id="Page_798">798</a></span>
self-direction ("being for oneself"). This leads us
to say that He made Himself; for, since He is the
author of will, and as this will is more or less His work,
and as it is identical with His essence, (we may say
that) He gave himself the form of (hypostatic) existence.
Not by chance therefore is He what He is; He
is what He is because He wished to be such.</p>

<h3>IN ANALYSIS CONTINGENCY IS ELIMINATED.</h3>

<p>14. Here is still another point of view from which
the subject under discussion may be regarded. Each
one of the beings that are said to be existent, is either
identical with its essence, or differs from it. Thus,
some particular man differs from the Man-essence,
only participating therein. On the contrary, the soul
is identical with the Soul-essence, when she is simple,
and when she is not predicated of anything else. Likewise,
the Man-in-himself is identical with the Man-essence.
The man who is other than the Man-essence
is contingent; but the Man-essence is not contingent;
the Man-in-himself exists in himself. If then the essence
of man exist by itself, if it be neither fortuitous
nor contingent, how could contingency be predicated
of Him who is superior to Man in himself, and who
begat him, from whom all beings are derived, since
His is a nature simpler than the Man-essence, and even
of essence in general? If, in ascending towards greater
simplicity, contingency decreases, so much the more
impossible is it that contingency could extend to the
Nature that is the simplest (namely, the Good).</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME IS BOTH BEING AND CAUSE.</h3>

<p>Let us also remember that each of the beings which
exist genuinely, as we have said, and which have
received their form of hypostatic existence from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_799" id="Page_799">799</a></span>
Good, likewise owe it to Him that they are individual,
as are the similarly situated sense-beings. By such
individual beings is here meant having in one's own
being the cause of his hypostatic existence. Consequently,
He who then contemplates things can give
an account of each of their details, to give the cause
of the individuality of eyes or feet, to show that the
cause of the generation of each part is found in its
relations with the other parts, and that they have all
been made for each other. Why are the feet of a particular
length? Because some other organ is "such";
for instance, the face being such, the feet themselves
must be such. In one word, the universal <span class="locked">harmony<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></span>
is the cause on account of which all things were made
for each <span class="locked">other.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></span> Why is the individual such a thing?
Because of the Man-essence. Therefore the essence
and the cause coincide. They issued from the same
source, from the Principle which, without having need
of reasoning, produced together the essence and the
cause. Thus the source of the essence and the cause
produces them both simultaneously. Such then are
begotten things, such is their principle, but in a much
superior and truer manner; for in respect of excellence,
it possesses an immense superiority over them. Now
since it is not fortuitously, neither by chance, nor contingently,
that the things which bear their cause in
themselves, are what they are; since, on the other hand,
(the Divinity) possesses all the entities of which He
is the principle, evidently, being the Father of reason,
of cause, and of causal being&mdash;all of them entities
entirely free from contingence&mdash;he is the Principle and
type of all things that are not contingent, the Principle
which is really and in the highest degree independent
of chance, of fortune, and of contingency; He is the
cause of Himself, He is He by virtue of Himself; for
He is Self in a primary and transcendent manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_800" id="Page_800">800</a></span></p>

<h3>THE SUPREME CO-EXISTS WITH HIMSELF, AND IS
SUCH AS HE WISHES TO BE.</h3>

<p>15. He is simultaneously the lovable and love; He
is love of himself; for He is beautiful only by and in
Himself. He coexists with Himself only on condition
that the thing, which exists in Himself, is identical with
Him. Now as in Him the thing that coexists is identical
with Him, and as in Him also that which desires, and
that which is desirable play the part of hypostasis
and subject, here once more appears the identity of
desire and "being." If this be so, it is evidently again
He who is the author of Himself, and the master of
Himself; consequently, He was made not such as some
other being desired it, but He is such as He Himself
desires.</p>

<h3>MEN ESCAPE CHANCE BY INFERIOR ISOLATION;
THEREFORE THE SUPREME MUST BE FREE.</h3>

<p>When we assert that (the Divinity) Himself receives
nothing, and is received by no other being, we thereby
in another way prove that He is what He is, not by
chance. This is the case because He isolates Himself,
and preserves Himself uninfected from all things. Besides,
we sometimes see that our nature possesses something
similar, when it finds itself disengaged from all
that is attached to us, and subjects us to the sway of
fortune and fatality&mdash;for all the things that we call
ours are dependent, and undergo the law of fortune,
happening to us fortuitously. Only in this manner is
one master of himself, possessing free will, by virtue of
an actualization of the light which has the form of
the Good, of an actualization of the Good, which is
superior to intelligence; of an actualization which is
not adventitious, and which is above all thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_801" id="Page_801">801</a></span>
When we shall have risen thither, when we shall have
become that alone, leaving all the rest, shall we not
say that we are then above even liberty and free will?
Who then could subject us to chance, to fortune, to
contingency, since we shall have become the genuine
life, or rather, since we shall be in Him who derives
nothing from any other being, who is solely himself?
When other beings are isolated, they do not suffice
themselves; but He is what He is, even when isolated.</p>

<h3>THE ASCENT OF LIFE WITNESS TO THE DISAPPEARANCE
OF CONTINGENCY.</h3>

<p>The first hypostatic form of existence does not consist
in an inanimate entity or in an irrational life; for
an irrational life is but weak in essence, being a dispersion
of reason, and something indeterminate. On
the contrary, the closer life approaches reason, the
further is it from contingency, for that which is rational
has nothing to do with chance. Ascending then (to
the Divinity) He does not seem to us to be Reason,
but what is still more beautiful than Reason; so far is
He from having arisen by chance! Indeed, He is the
very root of Reason, for it is the goal at which all
things find their consummation. He is the principle
and foundation of an immense Tree which lives by
reason; He remains in Himself, and imparts essence
to the Tree by the reason He communicates.</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME AS EVERYWHERE AND NOWHERE;
AS INCLINATION AND IMMANENCE.</h3>

<p>16. As we assert, and as it seems evident that (the
Divinity) is everywhere and nowhere, it is necessary
thoroughly to grasp and understand this conception,
as it applies to the subject of our studies. Since
(the Divinity) is nowhere, He is nowhere fortuitously;
since He is everywhere, He is everywhere what He is.
He himself is therefore what is named omnipresence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_802" id="Page_802">802</a></span>
and universality. He is not contained within omnipresence,
but is omnipresence itself, and He imparts
essence to all the other beings because they are all contained
within Him who is everywhere. Possessing the
supreme rank, or rather Himself being supreme, He
holds all things in obedience to Himself. For them He
is not contingent; it is they that are contingent to Him,
or rather, that connect with Him; for it is not He who
contemplates them, but they who look at Him. On His
part, He, as it were, moves towards the most intimate
depths within Himself, loving Himself, loving the pure
radiance of which He is formed, Himself being what He
loves, that is, giving Himself a hypostatic form of existence,
because He is an immanent actualization, and
what is most lovable in Him constitutes the higher Intelligence.
This Intelligence being an operation, He
himself is an operation; but as He is not the operation
of any other principle, He is the operation of Himself;
He therefore is not what chance makes of Him, but
what He actualizes. He is the author of Himself,
inasmuch as He exists particularly because He is His
own foundation, because He contemplates Himself, because,
so to speak, He passes His existence in contemplating
Himself. He therefore is, not what He fortuitously
found Himself to be, but what He himself
wishes to be, and as His will contains nothing fortuitous,
He is even in this respect independent of contingency.
For, since His will is the will of the Best
that is in the universe, it could not be fortuitous. If
one were to imagine an opposite movement, one will
easily recognize that His inclination towards Himself,
which is His actualization, and His immanence in Himself
make of Him what He is. Indeed, should (the
divinity) incline towards what is outside of Himself,
He would cease being what He is. His actualization,
in respect to Himself, is to be what He is; for He and
that actualization coincide. He therefore gives Himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_803" id="Page_803">803</a></span>
a hypostatic form of existence, because the actualization
that He produces is inseparable from Himself.
If then the actualization of (the divinity) did not
merely commence, but if, on the contrary, it dated
from all eternity; if it consist in an exciting <span class="locked">action,<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></span>
identical to Him who is excited; and if, besides this
exciting action, He be ever-being super-intellection,
then (the divinity) is what He makes himself by His
exciting action. The latter is superior to "Being,"
to Intelligence, and to the Life of Wisdom; it is Himself.
He therefore is an actualization superior to Life,
Intelligence and Wisdom; these proceed from Him,
and from Him alone. He therefore derives essence
from Himself, and by Himself; consequently, He is,
not what He fortuitously found Himself to be, but what
He willed to be.</p>

<h3>PROVIDENCE, THE PLAN OF THE UNIVERSE, IS
FROM ETERNITY.</h3>

<p>17. Here is another proof of it. We have stated
that the world and the "being" it contains are what
they would be if their production had been the result
of a voluntary determination of their author, what they
would still be if the divinity exercising a prevision and
prescience based on reasoning, had done His work
according to Providence. But as (these beings) are
or become what they are from all eternity, there must
also, from eternity&mdash;within the coexistent beings, exist
("seminal) reasons" which subsist in a plan more perfect
(than that of our universe); consequently, the intelligible
entities are above Providence, and choice;
and all the things which exist in Essence subsist eternally
there, in an entirely intellectual existence. If the name
"Providence" be applied to the plan of the universe,
then immanent Intelligence certainly is anterior to the
plan of the universe, and the latter proceeds from
immanent Intelligence, and conforms thereto.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_804" id="Page_804">804</a></span><a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></p>

<h3>THE SUPREME, ASSISTED BY INTELLIGENCE, WOULD
HAVE NO ROOM FOR CHANCE.</h3>

<p>Since Intelligence is thus anterior to all things, and
since all things are (rooted) in such an Intelligence as
principle, Intelligence cannot be what it is as a matter
of chance. For, if on one hand, Intelligence be
multiple, on the other hand it is in perfect agreement
with itself, so that, by co-ordination of the elements
it contains, it forms a unity. Once more, such a principle
that is both multiple and co-ordinated manifoldness,
which contains all ("seminal) reasons" by embracing
them within its own universality, could not
be what it is as a result of fortune or chance. This
principle must have an entirely opposite nature, as
much differing from contingency, as reason from
chance, which consists in the lack of reason. If the
above Intelligence be the (supreme) Principle, then
Intelligence, such as it has been here described, is
similar to this Principle, conforms to it, participates in
it, and is such as is wished by it and its power. (The
Divinity) being indivisible, is therefore a (single)
Reason that embraces everything, a single (unitary)
Number, and a single (Divinity) that is greater and
more powerful than the generated (universe); than
He, none is greater or better. From none other, therefore,
can He have derived His essence or qualities.
What He is for and in Himself, is therefore derived
from Himself; without any relation with the outside,
nor with any other being, but entirely turned towards
Himself.</p>

<h3>CHANCE COULD NOT CAUSE THE ONE THAT IS THE
CENTRE OF THE CIRCULAR INTELLIGENCE.</h3>

<p>18. If then you seek this (Principle), do not expect
to find anything on the outside of Him; in Him
seek all that is after Him, but do not seek to penetrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_805" id="Page_805">805</a></span>
within Him; for He is what is outside (of everything),
the comprehension of all things, and their <span class="locked">measure.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></span>
Simultaneously, He is the internal, being the most intimate
depth of all things; (in which case) the external
would be (represented by) Reason and Intelligence,
which like a circumference fit around Him and depend
from Him. Indeed, Intelligence is such only because it
touches Him, and so far as it touches Him, and depends
from <span class="locked">Him<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></span>; for it is its dependence from Him
that constitutes its intelligence. It resembles a circle
which is in contact with its centre. It would be universally
acknowledged that such a circle would derive
all its power from the centre, and would, in a higher
sense, be centriform. Thus the radii of such a circle
unite in a single centre by extremities similar to the
distal and originating (extremities). These (distal)
extremities, though they be similar to the centric ones,
are nevertheless but faint traces thereof; for the latter's
potentiality includes both the radii and their (distal)
extremities; it is everywhere present in the radii, manifests
its nature therein, as an immature development.
This is an illustration how Intelligence and Essence
were born from (the divinity) as by effusion or development;
and by remaining dependent from the intellectual
nature of the Unity, it thereby manifests an
inherent higher Intelligence, which (speaking strictly),
is not intelligence, since it is the absolute Unity. A
centre, even without radii or circumference, is nevertheless
the "father" of the circumference and the radii,
for it reveals traces of its nature, and by virtue of an
immanent potency, and individual force, it begets the
circumference and the radii which never separate from
it. Similarly, the One is the higher archetype of the
intellectual power which moves around Him, being
His image. For in the Unity there is a higher Intelligence
which, so to speak, moving in all directions and
manners, thereby becomes Intelligence; while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_806" id="Page_806">806</a></span>
Unity, dwelling above Intelligence, begets it by its
power. How then could fortune, contingency and
chance approach this intelligence-begetting Power, a
power that is genuinely and essentially creative? Such
then is what is in Intelligence, and such is what is in
Unity, though that which is in Him is far superior.</p>

<h3>AS CAUSE, SUITABILITY, AND OPPORTUNITY, THE
SUPREME IS BEYOND CHANCE.</h3>

<p>(As illustration), consider the radiance shed afar
by some luminous source that remains within itself;
the radiation would represent the image, while the
source from which it issues would be the genuine
<span class="locked">light.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></span> Nevertheless, the radiation, which represents
the intelligence, is not an image that has a form foreign
(to its principle), for it does not exist by chance, being
reason and cause in each of its parts. Unity then is
the cause of the cause; He is, in the truest sense,
supreme causality, simultaneously containing all the
intellectual causes He is to produce; this, His offspring,
is begotten not as a result of chance, but according to
His own volition. His volition, however, was not
irrational, fortuitous, nor accidental; and as nothing
is fortuitous in Him, His will was exactly suitable.
Therefore <span class="locked">Plato<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></span> called it the "suitable," and the
"timely," to express as clearly as possible that the
(Divinity) is foreign to all chance, and that He is that
which is exactly suitable. Now if He be exactly suitable,
He is so not irrationally. If He be timely, He
must (by a Greek pun), also be "supremely sovereign"
over the (beings) beneath Him. So much the
more will He be timely for Himself. Not by chance
therefore is He what He is, for He willed to be what
He is; He wills suitable things, and in Him that which
is suitable, and the actualization thereof, coincide. He
is the suitable, not as a subject, but as primary actualization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807">807</a></span>
manifesting Him such as it was suitable for
Him to be. That is the best description we can give
of Him, in our impotence to express ourselves about
Him as we should <span class="locked">like.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></span></p>

<h3>NO PERSON WHO HAS SEEN THE SUPREME COULD
POSSIBLY CALL HIM CHANCE.</h3>

<p>19. By the use of the above indications (it is
possible), to ascend to Him. Having done so, grasp
Him. Then you will be able to contemplate Him, and
you will find no terms to describe His (greatness).
When you shall see Him, and resign any attempt at
spoken description, you will proclaim that He exists
by Himself in a way such that, if He had any being,
it would be His servant, and would be derived from
Him. No one who has ever seen Him would have the
audacity to maintain that He is what He is by chance;
nor even to utter such a blasphemy, for He would be
confounded by his own temerity. Having ascended to
Him, the (human observer) could not even locate His
presence, as it were rising up everywhere before the
eyes of his soul. Whichever way the soul directs her
glances, she sees Him, unless, on considering some
other object, she abandons the divinity by ceasing to
think of Him.</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME IS ABOVE BEING BECAUSE NOT
DEPENDENT THEREON.</h3>

<p>The ancient (philosophers), in enigmatical utterances,
said that (the divinity) is above <span class="locked">"being."<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></span>
This must be understood to mean not only that He
begets being, but because He is not dependent on
"being" or on Himself. Not even His own "being"
is to Him a principle; for He himself is the principle
of "being." Not for Himself did he make it; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_808" id="Page_808">808</a></span>
having made it, He left it outside of Himself, because
He has no need of essence, since He himself made it.
Thus, even though He exist, He does not produce that
which is meant by that verb.</p>

<h3>HAVING MADE HIMSELF DOES NOT IMPLY ANY
PRIORITY IN THE DIVINITY.</h3>

<p>20. It will be objected that the above implies the
existence (of the Divinity) before He existed; for, if
He made Himself, on the one hand, He did not yet
exist, if it was Himself that He made; and on the other,
so far as it was He who made, He already existed
before Himself, since what has been made was Himself.
However, (the Divinity) should be considered
not so much as "being made" but as "making," and
we should realize that the actualization by which He
created Himself is absolute; for His actualization does
not result in the production of any other "being." He
produces nothing but Himself, He is entirely Himself;
we are not dealing here with two things, but with a
single entity. Neither need we hesitate to admit that the
primary actualization has no "being"; but that actualization
should be considered as constituting His hypostatic
form of existence. If within Him these two
were to be distinguished, the superlatively perfect
Principle would be incomplete and imperfect. To add
actualization to Him would be to destroy His unity.
Thus, since the actualization is more perfect than His
being, and since that which is primary is the most
perfect, that which is primary must necessarily be
actualization. He is what He is as soon as He actualizes.
He cannot be said to have existed before He made
Himself; for before He made Himself He did not exist;
but (from the first actualization) He already existed
in entirety. He therefore is an actualization which
does not depend on being, (an actualization) that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_809" id="Page_809">809</a></span>
clearly free; and thus He (originates) from Himself.
If, as to His essence, He were preserved by some other
principle, He himself would not be the first proceeding
from Himself. He is said to contain Himself because
He produces (and parades) Himself; since it is from
the very beginning that He caused the existence of
what He naturally contains. Strictly, we might indeed
say, that He made Himself, if there existed a time
when He himself began to exist. But since He was
what He is before all times, the statement that He
made Himself means merely that "having made" and
"himself" are inseparable; for His essence coincides
with His creative act, and, if I may be permitted to
speak thus, with his "eternal generation."</p>

<h3>HOW THE SUPREME MAY BE SAID TO COMMAND
HIMSELF.</h3>

<p>Likewise, the statement that the (divinity) commands
Himself may be taken strictly, if in Him be two
entities (the commander and the commanded); but
if (we may not distinguish such a pair of entities)
there is only one entity within Him, and He is only
the commander, containing nothing that obeys. How
then, if He contain nothing that was commanded,
could He command Himself? The statement that He
commands Himself means that, in this sense, there is
nothing above Him; in which case He is the First, not
on account of the numerical order, but by His authority
and perfectly free power. If He be perfectly free, He
cannot contain anything that is not free; He must
therefore be entirely free within Himself. Does He
contain anything that is not Himself, that He does not
do, that is not His work? If indeed He contained
anything that was not His work, He would be neither
perfectly free nor omnipotent; He would not be free,
because He would not dominate this thing; nor would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_810" id="Page_810">810</a></span>
He be omnipotent, because the thing whose making
would not be in His power would even thereby evade
His dominion.</p>

<h3>FURTHER OBJECTIONS TO THE SELF-AUTOCRACY
OF THE DIVINITY.</h3>

<p>21. Could (the divinity) have made Himself different
from what He made Himself? (If he could
not, He would not have been omnipotent). If you
remove from Him the power of doing evil, you thereby
also remove the power of doing good. (In the
divinity), power does not consist in the ability to
make contraries; it is a constant and immutable power
whose perfection consisted precisely in not departing
from unity; for the power to make contraries is a
characteristic of a being incapable of continuously
persisting in the best. Self-creation (the actualization
by which the divinity created Himself) exists once
for all, for it is perfect. Who indeed could change an
actualization produced by the will of the Divinity, an
actualization that constitutes His very will? But how
then was this actualization produced by the volition
(of the divinity) which did not yet exist?</p>

<p>What could be meant by the "volition of (the
Divinity") if He had not yet willed hypostatic form
of existence (for Himself)? Whence then came His
will? Would it have come from His being (which,
according to the above objection) was not yet actualized?
But His will was already within His "being."
In the (Divinity), therefore, there is nothing which
differs from His "being." Otherwise, there would
have been in Him something that would not have been
His will. Thus, everything in Him was will; there was
in Him nothing that did not exercise volition; nothing
which, therefore, was anterior to His volition. Therefore,
from the very beginning, the will was He; therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811">811</a></span>
the (Divinity) is as and such as He willed it to
be. When we speak of what was the consequence of
the will (of the Divinity), of what His will has produced,
(we must indeed conclude that) His will produced
nothing that He was not already. The statement
that (the Divinity) contains Himself means (no more
than that) all the other beings that proceed from Him
are by Him sustained. They indeed exist by a sort of
participation in Him, and they relate back to Him.
(The Divinity) Himself does not need to be contained
or to participate; He is all things for Himself; or rather,
He is nothing for Himself, because He has no need
of all the other things in respect to Himself.</p>

<h3>THE OBSTACLE TO THE DIVINITY IS FAILURE TO
ABSTRACT ENOUGH FROM HIM.</h3>

<p>Thus, whenever you wish to speak of (the Divinity),
or to gain a conception of Him, put aside all the rest.
When you will have made abstraction of all the rest,
and when you will thus have isolated (the Divinity),
do not seek to add anything to Him; rather examine
whether, in your thought, you have not omitted to
abstract something from Him. Thus you can rise to
a Principle of whom you could not later either assert
or conceive anything else. Classify in the supreme
rank, therefore, none but He who really is free, because
He is not even dependence on Himself; and because
he merely is Himself, essentially Himself, while
each of the other beings is itself, and something else
besides.</p>

<h3>HEAVEN, THOUGH IN FLUX, PERPETUATES ITSELF
BY FORM.</h3>

<p>1. Nothing will be explained by the perfectly true
(Stoic) statement that the world, as corporeal being
that ever existed and that will ever exist, is indebted
for the cause of its perpetuity to the volition of the
divinity. We might find an analogy between the
change of the elements, and the death of animals without
the perishing of the form of the species here below,
and the universe above, whose body is subject to a
perpetual flux and flow. Thus the divine volition
could preserve for it the same specific form in spite
of successive alterations, so that, without perpetually
retaining numerical unity, it would ever preserve the
specific unity of form. It would indeed be a remarkable
discrepancy in the methods of nature that here
below in animals the form alone should be perpetual,
while in the heaven and the stars their individuality
should be considered as perpetual as their form.</p>

<h3>THERE MUST INEVITABLY BE CHANGE IN HEAVEN.</h3>

<p>The incorruptibility of the heaven has been ascribed
to its containing within its breast all <span class="locked">things,<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></span> and to
the non-existence of any other thing into which it
could change, as well as to the impossibility of its
meeting anything exterior that could destroy it. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_814" id="Page_814">814</a></span>
theories would indeed, in a reasonable manner, explain
the incorruptibility of heaven considered as totality,
and universe; but would fail to explain the perpetuity
of the sun and of the other stars which are parts of
heaven, instead of being the whole universe, as is the
heaven. It would seem more reasonable that, just like
the fire and similar things, the stars, and the world
considered as universe would possess a perpetuity
chiefly of form. It is quite possible that the heaven,
without meeting any destructive exterior thing, should
be subjected to a perpetual destruction such that it
would preserve nothing identical but the form, from
the mere mutual destruction of its parts. In this case
its substrate, being in a perpetual flux, would receive
its form from some other principle; and we would be
driven to recognize in the universal living Organism
what occurs in man, in the horse, and in other animals;
namely, that the man or horse (considered as species)
lasts forever, while the individual changes. (According
to this view, then) the universe will not be constituted
by one ever permanent part, the heaven, and
another ceaselessly changing one, composed of terrestrial
things. All these things will then be subject to
the same condition though they might differ by longer
or shorter duration, since celestial bodies are more
durable. Such a conception of the perpetuity characteristic
of the universe and its parts contains less
ambiguity (than the popular notion), and would be
freed from all doubt if we were to demonstrate that
the divine power is capable of containing the universe
in this manner. The theory that the world contains
something perpetual in its individuality would demand
not only a demonstration that the divine volition can
produce such an effect, but also an explanation why
certain things (according to that theory) are always
identical (in form and individuality), while other
things are identical only by their form. If the parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815">815</a></span>
of the heaven alone remained identical (by their individuality),
all other things also should logically remain
(individually) identical.</p>

<h3>REJECTION OF THE OPINION OF HERACLITUS.</h3>

<p>2. An admission that the heaven and the stars are
perpetual in their individuality, while sublunary things
are perpetual only in their form, would demand demonstration
that a corporeal being can preserve its
individuality as well as its form, even though the
nature of bodies were a continual fluctuation. Such is
the nature that the physical <span class="locked">philosophers,<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></span> and even
Plato himself, attribute not only to sublunar bodies,
but even to celestial ones. "For," asks (Plato<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a>), "how
could corporeal and visible objects subsist ever immutable
and identical with themselves?" (Plato)
therefore admits the opinion of Heraclitus that "the
sun itself is in a state of perpetual becoming (or,
growth)."<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>

<h3>ARISTOTLE HAS TO DEPEND ON QUINTESSENCE.</h3>

<p>On the contrary, in the system of Aristotle, the
immutability of the stars is easily explained, but only
after accepting his theory of a fifth element (the
<span class="locked">quintessence<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></span>). If, however, it be rejected, it would
be impossible to demonstrate that the heaven, let alone
its parts, the sun and the stars, do not perish, while
(as Aristotle does) we regard the body of the heaven
as being composed of the same elements as terrestrial
animals.</p>

<h3>PLOTINOS'S VIEWS SUPPORTED BY THE HEAVEN'S
POSSESSION OF THE SOUL AND BODY.</h3>

<p>As every animal is composed of soul and body, the
heaven must owe the permanence of its individuality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_816" id="Page_816">816</a></span>
to the nature either of its soul, or of its body; or again,
to that of both. On the hypothesis that its incorruptibility
is due to the nature of its body, the Soul's
only function will be to animate it (by uniting with
the body of the world). On the contrary hypothesis
that the body, by nature corruptible, owes its incorruptibility
exclusively to the Soul, there is need of
demonstration that the state of the body does not
naturally oppose this constitution and permanence
(for, naturally constituted objects admit of no disharmony);
but that, on the contrary, here matter, by
its predisposition, contributes to the accomplishment
of the divine volition.</p>

<h3>FLUCTUATION NEED NOT INTERFERE WITH
CONTINUANCE.</h3>

<p>3. (It might however be objected) that the body
of the world could not contribute to the immortality
of the world, since the body itself fluctuates perpetually.
But this fluctuation does not take place in an outward
direction, while the body (of the world) remains
ever the same because this fluctuation occurs so entirely
within the world that nothing issues therefrom. The
world therefore could neither increase nor diminish,
nor further grow old. (As proof of this we may)
consider how, from all eternity, the earth constantly
preserves the same shape and mass; similarly, the air
never diminishes, any more than the water. The
changes within them do not affect the universal living
Organism. Even we human beings subsist a long
while, in spite of the perpetual change of our constituent
parts, and though some of these parts even
issue from the body. So much the more will the
world's nature, from which nothing issues, sufficiently
harmonize with the nature of the universal Soul to
form along with her an organism which ever remains
the same, and subsists for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_817" id="Page_817">817</a></span></p>

<h3>FIRE, THOUGH AN APPARENT EXCEPTION, STILL
CONFORMS TO THIS PROCEDURE.</h3>

<p>For example, fire (as the principal element of the
heaven), is both lively and swift, and cannot remain
in the inferior regions, any more than the earth can
abide in the superior regions. When it has reached
these regions where it is to remain, it becomes established
in the most suitable place. But even so, like
all other bodies, it still seeks to extend in all directions.
However, it cannot ascend, since there is no place
higher than the one it occupies; nor can it descend,
because of the opposition of its own nature. The only
thing left for it to do is to yield to the guidance and
natural impulsion of the life-imparting universal Soul,
that is, to move into the most beautiful place, in the
universal Soul. Its falling from here is prevented by
the universal Soul's circular movement which dominates
and supports it, as well as by its innate indisposition
to descend, so that its continuance in the
higher regions is unopposed. (The fire has no similarity
with) the constitutive parts of our body which
are forced to derive their suitable form from elsewhere.
If unaided, they are not even capable of preserving
their organization. Merely to subsist, they are
forced to borrow parts from other objects. The case
is entirely different with the fire of the heaven, which
needs no food because it loses nothing. If indeed it
allowed anything to escape, we might indeed be forced
to state that when in the heaven a fire is extinguished,
a substitute must be lit. But in such a case the universal
living Organism would no more remain identical.</p>

<h3>THE IMMORTALITY OF THE HEAVEN IS DUE TO
RESIDENCE THERE OF THE UNIVERSAL SOUL.</h3>

<p>4. Apart from the exigencies of our argument, it
may be interesting to consider whether there be any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_818" id="Page_818">818</a></span>
wastage off from heaven, so as to create a need of
being (replenished or) fed, so to speak; or whether
all its contents, being once for all established, subsist
there naturally, without allowing any of their substance
to escape. In the latter case we would be driven
further to inquire whether the heaven be composed of
fire exclusively or <span class="locked">principally<a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></span>; and whether, while
dominating the other elements, the fire engages them
in its course. Were we to associate (with fire) the
Soul, which is the most powerful of all causes, so as to
unite her with elements so pure and excellent (just
as, in other animals, the soul chooses the best parts
of the body as dwelling-place), we would have produced
a solid argument for the immortality of the
heaven. Aristotle indeed says that the flame surges,
and that the fire devours everything with an insatiable
<span class="locked">avidity<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></span>; but he was evidently speaking only of the
terrestrial fire, for the celestial fire is calm, immovable,
and in harmony with the nature of the stars.</p>

<h3>THE HEAVEN'S IMMORTALITY ALSO DUE TO THE
UNIVERSAL SOUL'S SPONTANEOUS MOTION.</h3>

<p>A still more important reason for the immortality
of the heaven is that the universal Soul, moving with
remarkable spontaneity, immediately succeeds the
most perfect principles (such as the Good, and Intelligence).
She could not therefore allow the annihilation
of anything which had once been posited within
her. Ignorance of the cause that contains the universe
could alone permit denial that the universal Soul which
emanates from the divinity excels all other bonds in
strength. It is absurd to believe that after having
contained something during a certain period, she could
ever cease doing so. This would imply that she had
done so till now by some violence; which would again
infer the existence of some plan more natural than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_819" id="Page_819">819</a></span>
actual state, and actual admirable disposition of beings
within the very constitution of the universe; which
would lastly suggest a force capable of destroying the
organization of the universe, and of undermining the
sovereignty of the governing Soul.</p>

<h3>THE IMMORTALITY OF THE HEAVEN PROVED BY
ITS NEVER HAVING HAD TO BEGIN.</h3>

<p>We have <span class="locked">elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></span> shown that it would be absurd
to suppose that the world ever had a beginning. This
however implies that it will never cease to exist. Why
indeed should it not continue to do so? Its component
elements are not, like wood, and similar things, exposed
to wastage. Their continued subsistence, however,
implies that the universe that they form must also
ever subsist. On the other hand, even if they were
subject to a perpetual change, the universe must still
subsist because the principle of this change subsists
continually. Moreover, it has elsewhere been <span class="locked">shown<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></span>
that the universal Soul is not subject to repentance,
because she governs the universe without difficulties
or fatigue, and that even in the impossible case that
the body of the universe should happen to perish, she
would not thereby be altered.</p>

<h3>WHY CELESTIAL THINGS LAST LONGER THAN
TERRESTRIAL ONES.</h3>

<p>5. The reason why celestial things endure beyond
terrestrial animals and elements has been thus stated
by <span class="locked">Plato<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></span>: "Divine animals were formed by the divinity
Himself, while the animals here below were formed
by the divinities, His offspring." What the divinity
(Himself) does could not possibly perish. This implies
the existence, below the demiurge (Intelligence),
of the celestial Soul, with our <span class="locked">souls.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></span> From the celestial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_820" id="Page_820">820</a></span>
Soul derives and flows an <span class="locked">apparent-form-of-an-image,<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></span>
which forms terrestrial animals. This inferior
soul imitates her intelligible principle (the celestial
Soul), without, however, being able to resemble
her completely&mdash;because she employs elements which
are less good (than the celestial elements); because the
place where she operates with them is less good (than
heaven)&mdash;and because the materials that she organizes
could not remain united. Consequently, terrestrial
animals could not last for ever. For the same reason
this soul does not dominate terrestrial bodies with as
much power (as the celestial Soul dominates celestial
things), because each of them is governed by another
(human) soul.</p>

<h3>IMMORTALITY DOES NOT EXTEND TO THE SUB-LUNAR
SPHERE.</h3>

<p>If we be right in attributing immortality to the
heaven, we shall have to extend that conception to
the stars it contains; for unless its parts endured,
neither could the heaven. However, the things beneath
the heaven do not form part of it. The region
which constitutes the heaven does not extend further
down than the moon. As to us, having our organs
formed by the (vegetative) soul which was given us
by the celestial divinities (the stars), and even the
heaven <span class="locked">itself,<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></span> we are united to the body by that soul.
Indeed, the other soul (the reasonable soul), which
constitutes our person, our <span class="locked">"me,"<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></span> is not the cause
of our <span class="locked">being,<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></span> but of our well-being (which consists
in our intellectual life). She comes to join our body
when it is already formed (by the vegetative soul),
and contributes to our being only by one part, by
giving us reason (in making of us reasonable beings,
and men).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_821" id="Page_821">821</a></span></p>

<h3>THE STARS CONTAIN NOT ONLY FIRE, BUT
TANGIBLE EARTH.</h3>

<p>6. Is the heaven composed exclusively of fire?
Does the fire allow any of its substance to flow off,
or escape? Does it, therefore, need being fed?
(Plato<a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a>) thinks the body of the universe is composed
of earth and fire; fire to explain its being visible, and
earth to explain its being tangible. This would lead
us to suppose that the stars are composed of fire not
exclusively, but predominatingly, since they seem to
possess a tangible element. This opinion is plausible
because Plato supports it with reasonable grounds.
Sense, sight and touch would lead us to believe that
the greater part, if not the whole, of the heaven, is
fire. But reason suggests that the heaven also contains
earth, because without earth it could not be <span class="locked">tangible.<a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></span>
This however does not imply that it contains also air
and water. It would seem absurd to think that water
could subsist in so great a fire; nor could air survive
therein without immediately being transformed to
steam. It might be objected that two solids which play
the parts of extremes in a proportion, cannot be united
without two <span class="locked">means.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></span> This objection, however, might
have no cogency, for this mathematical relation might
not apply to natural things, as indeed we are led to
surmise by the possibility of mingling earth and water
without any intermediary. To this it may be answered
that earth and water already contain the other elements.
Some persons might think that the latter could
not effectually unite earth and water; but this would
not disturb our contention that the earth and water are
related because each of these two elements contains
all the others.</p>

<h3>EARTH CONTAINS ALL THE OTHER ELEMENTS.</h3>

<p>Besides, we shall have to examine whether the earth
be invisible without fire, and the fire intangible without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_822" id="Page_822">822</a></span>
the earth. Were this the case, nothing would possess
its own proper being. All things would be mixed;
each would reclaim its name only by the element preponderating
in it; for it has been claimed that the earth
could not exist without the humidity of water, which
alone keeps all its parts united. Even were this granted,
it would, none the less, remain absurd to say that each
of these elements is something, while claiming that it
does not possess any characteristically individual constitution,
except by its union with the other elements,
which, nevertheless, would not, any the more, exist
individually, each in itself. What reality, indeed,
would inhere in the nature or being of the earth, if
none of its parts were earth except because the water
that operated as a bond? Besides, with what could
water unite without the preliminary existence of an
extension whose parts were to be bound together for
the formation of a continuous whole? The existence
of an extension, however small it be, will imply the
self-existence of earth, without the assistance of water;
otherwise, there would be nothing for water to bind
together. Nor would the earth have any need of air,
since the air exists before the observation of any
change within it. Nor is fire any more necessary to
the constitution of the earth; fire only serves in making
it visible, like all other objects. It is indeed reasonable
to assert that it is fire which renders objects visible,
and it is a <span class="locked">mistake<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></span> to state that "one sees darkness,"
which cannot be seen any more than silence can be
heard. Besides, there is no necessity for fire to be in
earth; light suffices (to make it visible). Snow, and
many other very cold substances are, without any fire,
very brilliant&mdash;that is, unless we say that the fire
approached them, and colored them before leaving
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_823" id="Page_823">823</a></span></p>

<h3>ELEMENTS ARE NEVERTHELESS INDIVIDUAL.</h3>

<p>As to the other elements, could not water exist without
participating in the earth? Air could certainly not
be said to participate in earth, because of its penetrability.
It is very doubtful that the fire contains any
earth, because it does not seem continuous, and does
not, by itself, seem to be tri-dimensional. True, fire
does seem to contain solidity, but not of a tri-dimensional
kind; it seems rather to be a sort of resistance
corporeal <span class="locked">nature<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></span>). Only of earth may hardness be
predicated; indeed, gold, in liquid state, is dense; not
because it is earth, but because it possesses density, and
is solidified. It would therefore not be unreasonable
that fire, apart by itself, could subsist by the power of
the Soul which sustains it by her presence. The bodies
of (certain among) the guardian spirits consist of
<span class="locked">fire.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></span></p>

<h3>TERRESTRIAL ELEMENTS, HOWEVER, DO NOT
DEGRADE THE HEAVEN.</h3>

<p>It is unlikely that the universal Organism is composed
of universal elements. That terrestrial animals
are thus composed is certain; but to introduce the
terrestrial element into the composition of the heaven
would be to admit something contrary to nature, and
to the order thereby established. (Epicurus's opinion
that) the stars carry terrestrial bodies along in their
rapid flight is undemonstrable. Besides, the presence
of the earth would be an obstacle to the shine and
splendor of the celestial fire.</p>

<h3>PLATO POSTULATED THE EXISTENCE OF EARTH
AS BASIS OF LIFE.</h3>

<p>7. Plato's <span class="locked">view<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></span> is to be accepted. The universe
must contain something solid, impenetrable, so that
the earth, when established in the middle of the universe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_824" id="Page_824">824</a></span>
might offer a firm foundation for all the animals
that walk on it, and that these animals might possess a
certain solidity by the very fact of their terrestriality;
so that the earth might, by itself, possess the property
of continuousness; that it might be illuminated by fire,
might also participate in water, so as not to be desiccated,
and so that its parts might unite, and that the
air might somewhat lighten its mass.</p>

<h3>ELEMENTS ARE KINDRED THROUGH THEIR COMMON
GROUND, THE UNIVERSE-BODY.</h3>

<p>The earth was mingled with the upper fire not to
produce the stars, but because fire has something
terrestrial, as earth has something igneous, as a result
of all the bodies being contained within the body of the
universe. In short, every one of the elements includes
mixture of itself and of the other with which it participates.
This results from the interrelating community
existing within the universe (the "sympathy").
So each element, without combining with any other,
borrows some of its properties. For example, water
participates in the fluidity of the air, without however
mingling therewith; so the earth does not possess the
fire, but derives its brightness from it. On the other
hand, a mixture would render all properties common
to both elements, confounding them <span class="locked">together,<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></span> and
would not limit itself to merely approximating earth
and fire, that is, a certain solidity with a certain density.
On this subject we can invoke the authority of
(Plato<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>), "The divinity lit this light in the second
circle above the earth," thereby referring to the sun,
which he elsewhere calls "the most brilliant star."</p>

<p>By these words he hinders us from admitting
that the sun is anything else than fire. He also indicates
that fire has no quality other than light,
which he considers as distinct from flame, and as
possessing only a gentle heat. This light is a body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_825" id="Page_825">825</a></span>
From it emanates another being that we, by verbal
similarity, also call light, and which we acknowledge to
be incorporeal. This second kind of light derives from
the former, being its flower and brightness, and constitutes
the essentially white (that is, brilliant) body
(of lightning, or comets). (Unfortunately, however),
the word "terrestrial" (which designates the element
allied to the fire, as we have said above), we are wont
to regard unfavorably because Plato makes the earth
consist of solidity, while we speak of the earth as a
unity, though (Plato) distinguishes several qualities
within this element.</p>

<h3>NATURE OF THE CELESTIAL FIRE AND LIGHT.</h3>

<p>The fire of which we speak above emits the purest
light, and resides in the highest region, by virtue of its
nature. These celestial flames are entirely distinct
from the earthly flame, which after ascending to a
certain height, and meeting a greater quantity of air,
becomes extinguished. After ascending, it falls back
on to the earth, because (as a comet) it cannot rise
any further; it stops in the sublunar regions, though
rendering the ambient air lighter. In those cases in
which it continues to subsist in higher regions, it becomes
weaker, gentler, and acquires a heatless glow,
which is but a reflection of the celestial light. The
latter, on the other hand, is divided partly among the
stars in which it reveals great contrasts of magnitude
and color, and partly in the atmosphere. Its invisibility
to our eyes is caused both by its tenuity, and
transparence, which causes it to become as tangible
as pure air, and also because of its distance from the
earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_826" id="Page_826">826</a></span></p>

<h3>CELESTIAL LIGHT IS NOT EXPOSED TO ANY
WASTAGE.</h3>

<p>8. Since this light subsists in elevated regions, because
the purity of its nature forces it to remain in
pure regions, it cannot be subject to any wastage (or,
leakage). Such a nature could not allow any escape
either downwards or upwards, nor could it meet anything
that would force it to descend. Moreover, it
will be remembered that there is a great difference of
condition in a body united to, or separated from a soul;
and in this case the body of the heaven is everywhere
united to the (universal) Soul.</p>

<h3>THE HEAVEN DOES NOT NEED THE ACTION OF
EITHER AIR OR FIRE.</h3>

<p>Besides, all that approaches the heaven is either air
or fire. What of it is air cannot affect the heaven.
What of it is fire can neither influence the heaven, nor
touch it, to act on it. Before acting on the heaven, it
would have to assume its nature; besides, fire is less
great or powerful than the heaven. Moreover, the
action of fire consists in heating; whereas, 1, that which
is to be heated cannot have been hot by itself; and
as, 2, that which is to be dissolved by fire must first be
heated, inasmuch as it is this heating which causes a
change of nature. No other body is needed for either
the subsistence of the heaven, or for the functioning
of its natural <span class="locked">revolutions.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></span> Moreover, the heaven
does not move in a straight line, because it is in the
nature of celestial things to remain immovable, or to
move in a circular orbit, and not to assume any other
kind of movement without compulsion by some superior
force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_827" id="Page_827">827</a></span></p>

<h3>THE STARS ARE INEXHAUSTIBLE. AND NEED NO
REFRESHMENT.</h3>

<p>Stars, therefore, stand in need of no <span class="locked">feeding,<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></span>
and we should not judge them according to our own
circumstances. Indeed, our (human) soul, which contains
our bodies, is not identical with the Soul that
contains the heaven; our soul does not reside in the
same place, while the world-Soul does not, like our
composite bodies lose (excreta). Not as our bodies
do the stars need continual metabolic replacing food.
From our conception of celestial bodies we should
remove all ideas of a change that could modify their
constitution. Terrestrial bodies are animated by an
entirely different <span class="locked">nature<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></span>; which though because of
its weakness is incapable of insuring them a durable
existence, nevertheless imitates the superior nature (of
the celestial Soul) by birth and generation. <span class="locked">Elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></span>
we have shown that even this very celestial
Soul cannot partake of the perfect immutability of intelligible
things.</p>

<span class="smaller">Of Sensation and Memory.</span></h2>

<h3>STOIC DOCTRINES OF SENSATIONS AND MEMORIES
HANG TOGETHER.</h3>

<p>If we deny that sensations are images impressed
on the soul, similar to the impression of a <span class="locked">seal,<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></span> we
shall also, for the sake of consistency, have to deny
that memories are notions or sensations preserved in
the soul by the permanence of the impression, inasmuch
as, according to our opinion, the soul did not
originally receive any impression. The two questions,
therefore, hang together. Either we shall have to
insist that sensation consists in an image impressed on
the soul, and memory, in its preservation; or, if either
one of these opinions be rejected, the other will have
to be rejected also. However, since we regard both
of them as false, we shall have to consider the true
operation of both sensation and memory; for we declare
that sensation is as little the impression of an
image as memory is its permanence. The true solution
of the question, on the contrary, will be disclosed
by an examination of the most penetrating <span class="locked">sense,<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></span> and
then by induction transferring the same laws to the
other senses.</p>

<h3 class="large">A. OF SENSATION.</h3>

<h3>THE SENSE OF SIGHT DOES NOT POSSESS THE
IMAGE SEEN WITHIN ITSELF.</h3>

<p>In general the sensation of sight consists of perception
of the visible object, and by sight we attain it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_830" id="Page_830">830</a></span>
the place where the object is placed before our eyes,
as if the perception operated in that very place, and as
if the soul saw outside of herself. This occurs, I
think, without any image being produced nor producing
itself outside of the soul, without the soul receiving
any impression similar to that imparted by
the seal to the wax. Indeed, if the soul already in
herself possessed the image of the visible object, the
mere possession of this image (or type) would free her
from the necessity of looking outside of herself. The
calculation of the distance of the object's location,
and visibility proves that the soul does not within
herself contain the image of the object. In this case,
as the object would not be distant from her, the soul
would not see it as located at a distance. Besides, from
the image she would receive from within herself, the
soul could not judge of the size of the object, or even
determine whether it possessed any magnitude at all.
For instance, taking as an example the sky, the image
which the soul would develop of it would not be so
great (as it is, when the soul is surprised at the sky's
extent). Besides, there is a further objection, which
is the most important of all. If we perceive only the
images of the objects we see, instead of seeing the
objects themselves, we would see only their appearances
or adumbrations. Then the realities would differ
from the things that we see. The true observation
that we cannot discern an object placed upon the
pupil, though we can see it at some little distance, applies
with greater cogency to the soul. If the image
of the visible object be located within her, she will
not see the object that yields her this image. We have
to distinguish two things, the object seen, and the
seeing subject; consequently, the subject that sees the
visible object must be distinct from it, and see it as
located elsewhere than within itself. The primary
condition of the act of vision therefore is, not that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_831" id="Page_831">831</a></span>
image of the object be located in the soul, but that it
be located outside of the soul.</p>

<h3>SENSATIONS ARE NOT EXPERIENCES, BUT RELATIVE
ACTUALIZATIONS.</h3>

<p>2. After denying that sensation consists of such an
operation, it is our duty to point out the true state of
affairs. Though it be objected that thus the soul would
be considered as judging of things she does not possess,
it is nevertheless plain that it is the characteristic
of a power, not to experience or suffer, but to develop
its force, to carry out the function to which it is
destined. If the soul is to discern a visible or audible
object the latter must consist of neither images nor
experiences, but actualizations relative to the objects
which naturally belong to the domain of these actualizations
of the soul. Those who deny that any faculty
can know its object without receiving some impulsion
from it imply that the faculty suffers, without really
cognizing the object before it; for this soul-faculty
should dominate the object instead of being thereby
dominated.</p>

<h3>THIS IS TRUE NOT ONLY OF SIGHT BUT OF HEARING,
TASTE AND SMELL.</h3>

<p>The case of hearing is similar to that of sight. The
impression is in the air; the sounds consist in a series
of distinct vibrations, similar to letters traced by some
person who is speaking. By virtue of her power and
her being, the soul reads the characters traced in the
air, when they present themselves to the faculty which
is suitable to reception of them. As to taste and smell
also, we must distinguish between the experience and
the cognition of it; this latter cognition constitutes
sensation, or a judgment of the experience, and differs
therefrom entirely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832">832</a></span><a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<h3>COGNITION OF INTELLIGIBLE OBJECTS STILL LESS
ADMITS OF AN IMPRESSION.</h3>

<p>The cognition of intelligible things still less admits
of an experience or impression; for the soul finds the
intelligible things within herself, while it is outside of
herself that she contemplates sense-objects. Consequently
the soul's notions of intelligible entities are
actualizations of a nature superior to those of sense-objects,
being the actualizations of the soul herself,
that is, spontaneous actualizations. We shall however
have to relegate to another <span class="locked">place<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></span> the question
whether the soul sees herself as double, contemplating
herself as another object, so to speak, and whether
she sees intelligence as single in a manner such that
both herself and intelligence seem but one.</p>

<h3 class="large">B. OF MEMORY.</h3>

<h3>MEMORY ACTS THROUGH THE SYMPATHY OF THE
SOUL'S HIGHEST SELF.</h3>

<p>3. Treating of memory, we must begin by attributing
to the soul a power which, though surprising,
is perhaps really neither strange nor incredible. The
soul, without receiving anything, nevertheless perceives
the things she does not have. The (secret of this) is
that by nature the soul is the reason of all things, the
last reason of intelligible entities, and the first reason
of <span class="locked">sense-objects.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></span> Consequently the soul is in relation
with both (spheres); by the intelligible things the soul
is improved and vivified; but she is deceived by the
resemblance which sense-objects bear to intelligible
entities, and the soul descends here below as if drawn
by her alluring charm. Because she occupies a position
intermediary between intelligible entities and sense-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_833" id="Page_833">833</a></span>objects,
the soul occupies a position intermediary between
them. She is said to think intelligible entities
when, by applying herself to them, she recalls them.
She cognizes them because, in a certain manner, she
actually constitutes these entities; she cognizes them,
not because she posits them within herself, but because
she somehow possesses them, and has an intuition of
them; because, obscurely constituting these things,
she awakes, passing from obscurity to clearness, and
from potentiality to actualization. For sense-objects
she acts in the same way. By relating them to what
she possesses within herself, she makes them luminous,
and has an intuition of them, possessing as she does
a potentiality suitable to (a perception of) them; and,
so to speak, to begetting them. When the soul has
applied the whole force of her attention to one of the
objects that offer themselves to her, she, for a long
while, thereby remains affected as if this object were
present; and the more attentively she considers it, the
longer she sees <span class="locked">it.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></span> That is why children have a
stronger memory; they do not quickly abandon an
object, but lingeringly fix their gaze upon it; instead
of allowing themselves to be distracted by a crowd
of objects, they direct their attention exclusively to
some one of them. On the contrary, those whose
thought and faculties are absorbed by a variety of
objects, do not rest with any one, and do no more
than look them over.</p>

<h3>MEMORY IS NOT AN IMAGE, BUT THE REAWAKENING
OF A FACULTY.</h3>

<p>If memory consisted in the preservation of <span class="locked">images,<a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></span>
their numerousness would not weaken memory.
If memory kept these images stored within itself,
it would have no need of reflection to recall them, nor
could memory recall them suddenly after having forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_834" id="Page_834">834</a></span>
them. Further, exercise does not weaken, but
increases the energy and force of memory, just as the
purpose of exercise of our feet or hands is only to
put ourselves in a better condition more easily to accomplish
certain things which are neither in our feet
nor our hands, but to which these members become
better adapted by habit.</p>

<p>Besides (if memory be only storage of images),
why then does one not remember a thing when it has
been heard but once or twice? Why, when it has been
heard often, is it long remembered, although it was
not retained at first? This can surely not be because
at first only some part of the images had been retained;
for in that case those parts would be easily recalled.
On the contrary, memory is produced suddenly as a
result of the last hearing or reflexion. This clearly
proves that, in the soul, we are only awaking the faculty
of memory, only imparting to it new energy, either
for all things in general, or for one in particular.</p>

<p>Again, memory does not bring back to us only the
things about which we have reflected; (by association
of ideas) memory suggests to us besides a multitude
of other memories through its habit of using certain
indices any one of which suffices easily to recall all
the <span class="locked">remainder<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></span>; how could this fact be explained except
by admitting that the faculty of memory had
become strengthened?</p>

<p>Once more, the preservation of images in the soul
would indicate weakness rather than strength, for the
reception of several impressions would imply an easy
yielding to all forms. Since every impression is an
experience, memory would be measured by passive
receptivity; which, of course, is the very contrary of
the state of affairs. Never did any exercise whatever
render the exercising being more fitted to suffering
(or, receptive experience).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_835" id="Page_835">835</a></span>
Still another argument: in sensations, it is not the
weak and impotent organ which perceives by itself;
it is not, for instance, the eye that sees, but the active
potentiality of the soul. That is why old people have
both sensations and memories that are weaker. Both
sensation and memory, therefore, imply some energy.</p>

<p>Last, as we have seen that sensation is not the impression
of an image in the soul, memory could not
be the storage-place of images it could not have received.</p>

<h3>MEMORY NEEDS TRAINING AND EDUCATION.</h3>

<p>It may be asked however, why, if memory be a
"faculty" (a potentiality) or <span class="locked">disposition,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></span> we do not
immediately remember what we have learned, and
why we need some time to recall it? It is because we
need to master our own faculty, and to apply it to its
object. Not otherwise is it with our other faculties,
which we have to fit to fulfil their functions, and
though some of them may react promptly, others also
may need time to gather their forces together. The
same man does not always simultaneously exercise
memory and judgment, because it is not the same
faculty that is active in both cases. Thus there is a
difference between the wrestler and the runner. Different
dispositions react in each. Besides, nothing
that we have said would militate against distinguishing
between the man of strong and tenacious soul who
would be inclined to read over what is recalled by his
memory, while he who lets many things escape him
would by his very weakness be disposed to experience
and preserve passive affections. Again, memory must
be a potentiality of the soul, inasmuch as the soul has
no extension (and therefore could not be a storage-place
for images which imply three dimensions).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_836" id="Page_836">836</a></span></p>

<h3>SOUL EVENTS OCCUR VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM
WHAT IS SUPPOSED BY THE UNOBSERVANT
OR UNREFLECTIVE.</h3>

<p>In general all the processes of the soul occur in a
manner very different from that conceived by unobservant
men. Psychic phenomena occur very differently
from sense-phenomena, the analogy of which
may lead to very serious errors. Hence the above
unobservant men imagine that sensations and memories
resemble characters inscribed on tablets or sheets of
<span class="locked">paper.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></span> Whether they consider the soul material
(as do the Stoics), or as immaterial (as do the Peripatetics),
they certainly do not realize the absurd
consequences which would result from the above
hypothesis.</p>

<h3>HISTORICAL REVIEW OF CATEGORIES.</h3>

<p>1. Very ancient philosophers have investigated the
number and kinds of essences. Some said there was
but <span class="locked">one;<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></span> others, that there was a limited number of
them; others still, an infinite number. Besides, those
who recognized but a single (essence) have advanced
opinions very different, as is also the case with those
who recognized a limited or unlimited number of essences.
As the opinions of these philosophers have
been sufficiently examined by their successors, we
shall not busy ourselves therewith. We shall study
the doctrine of those who, after having examined the
opinions of their predecessors, decided on determinate
numbers (of essences); admitting neither a single essence,
because they recognized that there was a multiplicity
even in the intelligibles; nor an infinite number
of essences, because such an infinity could not exist,
and would render all science impossible; but who,
classifying the essences whose number is limited, and
seeing that these classifications could not be considered
elements, looked on them as "kinds." Of these,
some (the Peripatetic Aristotelians) proposed ten,
while others proposed a lesser number (the Stoics
taught four), or a greater number (the Pythagorean
"oppositions," for instance). As to the kinds, there is
also difference of opinions: some looked upon the
kinds as principle (Plotinos himself); while others
(Aristotle) held that they formed classes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_838" id="Page_838">838</a></span></p>

<h3 class="large">OF THE TEN ARISTOTELIAN <span class="locked">CATEGORIES.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></span></h3>

<h3>STATEMENT OF ARISTOTLE'S POSITION.</h3>

<p>Let us first examine the doctrine that classifies essence
into ten (kinds). We shall have to investigate
whether it be necessary to acknowledge that its partisans
recognize ten kinds, all of which bear the name
of essence, or ten categories; for they <span class="locked">say<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></span> that essence
is not synonymous in everything, and they are right.</p>

<h3>ARISTOTLE'S CATEGORIES NEGLECT THE
INTELLIGIBLE WORLD.</h3>

<p>Let us begin by asking these philosophers whether
the ten kinds apply equally to sense-(essences), and
intelligible (essences), or whether they all apply to
the sense-(essences), and some only to the intelligible
(essences); for here there are no longer mutual relations.
We must therefore inquire which of those ten
kinds apply to intelligible essences, and see whether
intelligible essences can be reduced to one single kind,
that would also apply to sense-essences; and whether
the word <span class="locked">"being"<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></span> can be applied simultaneously to
intelligible and sense-entities, as a "homonymous"
label. For if "being" be a <span class="locked">homonym,<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></span> there are
several different kinds. If, however, it be a synonym
(or, name of common qualities) it would be absurd
that this word should bear the same meaning in the
essences which possess the highest degree of existence,
and in those which possess its lower degree; for the
things among which it is possible to distinguish both
primary and lower degrees could not belong to a
common kind. But these (Aristotelian) philosophers
do not, in their division, regard the (Platonic) intelligible
entities. They therefore did not mean to classify
all beings; they passed by those that possess the highest
degree of existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_839" id="Page_839">839</a></span><a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></p>

<h3 class="large">1. <span class="locked">Being.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></span></h3>

<p>2. Let us further examine if these ten divisions
be kinds, and how being could form a kind; for we
are forced to begin our study here.</p>

<h3>INTELLIGIBLE AND SENSE-BEING COULD NOT FORM
A SINGLE KIND.</h3>

<p>We have just said that intelligible being and sense-being
could not form a single <span class="locked">kind.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></span> Otherwise, above
both intelligible being, and sense-being, there might
be some third entity which would apply to both, being
neither corporeal nor incorporeal; for if it were incorporeal,
the body would be incorporeal; and if it
were corporeal, the incorporeal would be corporeal.</p>

<h3>QUESTIONS RAISED BY ARISTOTELIAN THEORIES.</h3>

<p>In the first place, what common element is there in
matter, form, and the concretion of matter and form?
The (Aristotelians) give the name of "being" alike to
these three entities, though recognizing that they are
not "being" in the same degree. They say that form
is more being than is <span class="locked">matter,<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></span> and they are right; they
would not insist (as do the Stoics) that matter is being
in the greater degree. Further, what element is common
to the primary and secondary beings, since the
secondary owe their characteristic title of "being" to
the primary ones?</p>

<h3>WHAT IS "BEING" IN GENERAL?</h3>

<p>In general, what is being? This is a question to
which the (Aristotelians) could find no answer; for
such mere indication of properties is not an essential
definition of what it is, and it would seem that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_840" id="Page_840">840</a></span>
property of being a thing that is susceptible of successively
admitting their contraries, while remaining
identical, and numerically <span class="locked">one,<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></span> could not apply to all
(intelligible) beings.</p>

<p>3. Can we assert that "being" is a category that
embraces simultaneously intelligible being, matter,
form, and the concretion of form and matter, on the
same justification that one may say that the race of
the Heraclidae form a kind, not because all its members
possess a common characteristic, but because they
are all descended from a common ancestry? In such
case, the first degree thereof will belong to this being
(from which all the rest is derived), and the second
degree to the other things which are less beings. What
then hinders that all things form a single category,
since all other things of which one may say, "they
subsist," owe this property to "being?"</p>

<p>Might it then be said that the other things are affections
(or, modifications),<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> and that the beings are
(hierarchically) subordinated to each other in a different
manner? In this case, however, we could not
stop at (the conception of) "being," and determine
its fundamental property so as to deduce from it other
beings. Beings would thus be of the same kind, but
then would possess something which would be outside
of the other <span class="locked">beings.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></span> Thus the secondary substance
would be attributed to something else, and leave no
meaning to "whatness" (quiddity or quality), "determinate
form" (thatness), "being a subject," "not
being a subject," "being in no subject," and "being
attributed to nothing <span class="locked">else,"<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></span> (as, when one says, whiteness
is a quality of the body, quantity is something of
substance, time is something of movement, and movement
is something of mobility), since the secondary
"being" is attributed to something <span class="locked">else.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></span> Another
objection would be, that the secondary being is attributed
to the primary Being, in another sense (than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_841" id="Page_841">841</a></span>
quality is to being), as "a kind," as "constituting a
part," as "being thus the essence of the subject," while
whiteness would be attributed to something else in this
sense that it is in a <span class="locked">subject.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></span> Our answer would be
that these things have properties which distinguish
them from the others; they will consequently be
gathered into a unity, and be called beings. Nevertheless,
no kind could be made up out of them, nor
thus arrive at a definition of the notion and nature
of being. Enough about this; let us pass to quantity.</p>

<h3 class="large">2. QUANTITY.</h3>

<p>4. The Aristotelians call quantity first "number,"
then "continuous size," "space," and <span class="locked">"time."<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></span> To
these concepts they apply the other kinds of quantity;
as for instance, they say that movement is a quantity
measured by <span class="locked">time.<a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></span> It might also be said reciprocally,
that time receives its continuity from movement.</p>

<h3>CONTINUOUS AND DEFINITE QUANTITY HAVE
NOTHING IN COMMON.</h3>

<p>If continuous quantity be quantity as far as it is
continuous, then definite quantity will no longer be
quantity. If, on the contrary, continuous quantity be
quantity only accidentally, then there is nothing in
common between continuous and definite quantity.
We will grant that numbers are quantities, although if
their nature of being quantities were plain, one would
not see why they should be given that name. As to
the line, the surface, and the body, they are called
sizes and not quantities; and the latter name is given
them only when they are estimated numerically; as
when, for instance, they are measured by two or three
<span class="locked">feet.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></span> A body is a quantity only in so far as it is
measured, just as space is a quantity only by accident,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_842" id="Page_842">842</a></span>
and not by its spatiality. We must here not consider
what is quantity by accident, but by its quantitativeness,
quantity itself. Three oxen are not a quantity;
in this case, the quantity is the number found in them.
Indeed, three oxen belong already to two categories.
The case is similar with the line, and the surface, both
of which possess such quantity. But if the quantity
of surface be quantity itself, why would surface itself
be a quantity? It is no doubt only when determined
by three or four lines that the surface is called a
quantity.</p>

<h3>NUMBERS ARE NOT QUANTITY IN ITSELF.</h3>

<p>Shall we then say that numbers alone are quantity?
Shall we attribute this privilege to Numbers in themselves,
which are beings, because they exist in themselves?<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a>
Shall we grant the same privilege to numbers
existing in things which participate in them,
and which serve to number, not unities, but ten oxen,
for example, or ten horses? First, it would seem
absurd that these numbers should not be beings, if the
former ones be such. Then, it will seem equally absurd
that they should exist within the things they
measure, without existing outside <span class="locked">them,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></span> as the rules
and instruments which serve to measure exist outside
of the objects they measure. On the other hand, if
these numbers that exist in themselves serve to
measure, and nevertheless do not exist within the
objects that they measure, the result will be that these
objects will not be quantities since they will not participate
in quantity itself.</p>

<h3>NUMBER IS NOT IN QUANTITY; BUT QUANTITY IS
IN NUMBER.</h3>

<p>Why should these numbers be considered quantities?
Doubtless because they are measures. But are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_843" id="Page_843">843</a></span>
these measures quantities, or quantity itself? As they
are in the order of beings, even if they should not
apply to any of the other things, the numbers will
nevertheless remain what they are, and they will be
found in quantity. Indeed, their unity designates an
object, since it applies to another; then the number
expresses how many objects there are, and the soul
makes use of number to measure plurality. Now,
when measuring thus, the soul does not measure the
"whatness" (or, quality) of the object, since she says
"one," "two," whatever be their objects, even if of
opposite nature; she does not determine the character
of each thing, for instance, if it be warm or beautiful;
she limits herself to estimating its quantity. Consequently,
whether we take Number in itself, or in the
objects which participate therein, quantity exists not
in these objects, but in the number; quantity finds
itself not in the object three feet long, but in the number
three.</p>

<h3>MAGNITUDE AND NUMBERS WOULD BE OF A DIFFERENT
TYPE OF QUANTITY.</h3>

<p>Why then should sizes also be quantities? Probably
because they approximate quantities, and because we
call quantities all objects that contain quantities, even
though we do not measure them with quantity in itself.
We call large what numerically participates in much;
and small what participates in little. Greatness and
smallness are quantities, not absolute, but relative;
nevertheless the Aristotelians say that they are relative
quantities so far as they seem to be <span class="locked">quantities.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></span> That
is a question to be studied; for, in this doctrine, number
is a kind apart, while sizes would hold second rank;
it is not exactly a kind, but a category which gathers
things which are near each other, and which may
hold first or second rank. As to us, we shall have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_844" id="Page_844">844</a></span>
examine if the Numbers which exist in themselves be
only substances, or if they be also quantities. In either
case, there is nothing in common between the Numbers
of which we speak, and those which exist in things
which participate <span class="locked">therein.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></span></p>

<h3>SPEECH AS A QUANTITY.</h3>

<p>5. What relation to quantity exists in speech, time,
and movement?</p>

<p>First, let us consider speech. It can be <span class="locked">measured.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></span>
In this respect, speech is a quantity, but not in so far
as it is speech, whose nature is to be significant, as
the noun, or the <span class="locked">verb.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></span> The vocal air is the matter
of the word, as it also is of the noun and the verb,
all which constitute the language. The word is principally
an impulse launched on the air, but it is not
a simple impulse; because it is articulated it somehow
fashions the air; consequently it is a deed, but a
significant one. It might be reasonably said that this
movement and impulse constitute a deed, and that the
movement which follows is a modification, or rather
that the first movement is the deed, and the second
movement is the modification of another, or rather
that the deed refers to the subject, and the modification
is in the subject. If the word consisted not in the
impulse, but in the air, there would result from the
significant characteristic of the expressive impulse two
distinct entities, and no longer a single category.</p>

<h3>NEITHER IS TIME A QUANTITY.</h3>

<p>Let us pass to <span class="locked">time.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></span> If it exist in what measures,
that which measures must be examined; it is doubtless
the soul, or the present instant. If it exist in what is
measured, it is a quantity so far as it has a quantity;
as, for instance, it may be a year. But, so far as it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_845" id="Page_845">845</a></span>
time, it has another nature; for what has such a quantity,
without (essentially) being a quantity, is not any
the less such a quantity.</p>

<h3>QUANTITY AS EQUAL AND UNEQUAL DOES NOT
REFER TO THE OBJECTS.</h3>

<p>As to (Aristotle's) assertion that the property of
quantity is to be both equal and <span class="locked">unequal,<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></span> this property
belongs to quantity itself, and not to the objects
which participate in quantity, unless it be by accident,
so far as one does not consider these objects in themselves.
A three foot object, for instance, is a quantity
so far as it is taken in its totality; but it does not form
a kind with quantity itself; only, along with it, it is
traced back to a kind of unity, a common category.</p>

<h3>RELATION.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></h3>

<p>6. Let us now consider relation. Let us see
whether, in relative matters, there be something common
that constitutes a kind, or which is a point of
union in any other manner. Let us, before everything
else, examine whether relation (as, for example, left
and right, double and half, and so forth) be a kind of
"hypostasis," or substantial act, or an habituation; or,
whether it be a kind of hypostatic existence in certain
things, while in others it is not so; or whether it be
this under no circumstances. What is there indeed
that is particular in relations such as double and half;
surpasser and surpassed; in possession, and in disposition;
lying down, standing, sitting; in the relation of
father and son; of master and slave; in the like and
different; the equal and unequal; the active and passive;
measurer and measured; sensation and knowledge?
Knowledge, for instance, relates to the object
which can be known, and sensation to sense-object;
for the relation of knowledge to the object which can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_846" id="Page_846">846</a></span>
be known has a kind of hypostatic existence in the
actualization relative to the form of the object which
can be known; likewise with the relation of sensation
to the sense-object. The same may be said about the
relation of the "active" to the "passive," which results
in a single actualization, as well as about the relation
between the measure and the measured object, from
which results mensuration. But what results from the
relation of the similar to the similar? If in this relation
there be nothing begotten, one can at least discover
there something which is its foundation, namely,
the identity of quality; nevertheless, neither of these
two terms would then have anything beside their proper
quality. The same may be said of equal things, because
the identity of quantity precedes the manner of
being of both things; this manner of being has no
foundation other than our judgment, when we say,
This one or that one are of the same size; this one has
begotten that one, this one surpasses that one. What
are standing and sitting outside of him who stands or
sits? As to the possession, if it apply to him who
possesses, it rather signifies the fact of possession; if
it apply to what is possessed, it is a quality. As much
can be said of disposition. What then exists outside
of the two relative terms, but the comparison established
by our judgment? In the relation of the thing
which surpasses the thing which is surpassed, the
first is some one size, and the second is some other
size; those are two independent things, while as to the
comparison, it does not exist in them, except in our
judgment. The relation of left to right and that of
the former to the latter consist in the different positions.
It is we who have imagined the distinction of
right to left; there is nothing in the objects themselves
that answers thereto. The former and the latter are
two relations of time, but it is we who have established
that distinction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_847" id="Page_847">847</a></span></p>

<h3>WHETHER THESE RELATIONS ARE SUBJECTIVE OR
OBJECTIVE.</h3>

<p>7. If, when we speak of things, we utter nothing
true, then there is nothing real in the relation, and this
kind of being has no foundation. But if, when we
compare two moments, we say, This one is anterior,
and that one is posterior, we speak truly, then we conceive
that the anterior and the posterior are something
independent of the subjects in which they exist. Likewise
with the left and the right, as well as with sizes;
we admit that in these, besides the quantity which is
suitable to them, there is a certain habituation, as far
as the one surpasses and the other is surpassed. If,
without our enunciating or conceiving anything, it be
real that such a thing is the double of another; if the
one possess while the other is possessed, even if we
had known nothing about it; if the objects had been
equal before we had noticed them; if they be likewise
identical in respect of quality; finally if, in all relative
things, there be a habituation which is independent of
the subjects in which it is found; and if we limit ourselves
to noticing its existence (without creating it);
if the same circumstances obtain in the relation of
knowledge to what can be known, a relation which
evidently constitutes a real habituation; if it be so,
there is nothing left to do but to ask whether this
habituation (named a relation) be something real.
We shall have to grant, however, that this habituation
subsists in certain subjects as long as these subjects
remain such as they were, and even if they were
separate; while, in other subjects, this habituation
is born only when they are brought together. We
shall also have to grant that, in the very subjects that
remain, there are some in which this habituation is
annihilated or altered (such as, for example, the left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_848" id="Page_848">848</a></span>
direction, or proximity). This has led people to believe
that in all these relations there is nothing real. This
point having been granted, we shall have to seek what
common element there is in all these relations, and to
examine whether what is common to them all constitutes
a kind, or an accident; and last, we shall have
to consider how far that which we have discovered
corresponds to reality.</p>

<h3>RELATIONS ARE SIMULTANEOUS EXISTENCES.</h3>

<p>We should call relative not what is said absolutely
of another thing, such as, for instance, the habits of
the soul and the body; nor what belongs to such a
thing, nor what is in such a thing (as for instance the
soul is said to be the soul of such an individual, or to
be in such a subject), but what wholly derives its existence
from this habit (called relation). By "hypostatic
existence" I here mean not the existence which
is proper to subjects, but the existence which is called
relative; as, for instance, the double causes the (correlative)
existence of the half; while it does not cause
the existence of the two foot object, nor of two in
general, nor the one foot object, nor one in general.
The manner of existence of these objects consists in
that this one is two, and that one one. As a result of
this, when these objects exist, the first is called double,
and is such in reality; and the second is half. These
two objects have therefore simultaneously and spontaneously
effected that the one was double, and the
other half. They have been correlatively begotten.
Their only existence lies in their correlation, so that the
existence of the double lies in its surpassing the half,
and the half derives its existence from its being surpassed
by the double. Consequently these two objects
are not, the one anterior, and the other posterior, but
<span class="locked">simultaneous.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></span> We might also examine whether or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_849" id="Page_849">849</a></span>
not other things do not also possess this simultaneity
of existence, as happens with father and son, and other
similar cases. The son continues to exist, indeed, even
after the death of the father; brother also survives
brother, since we often say that some one person resembles
some other deceased person.</p>

<h3>DISTINCTION BETWEEN ACTIVE HABITUATION
IMMEDIATE AND REMOTE.</h3>

<p>8. The above digression gives us the opportunity
of investigating why there should be a difference between
these relations, and those of which we spoke
above. However, we should be glad to have the
Aristotelians first state what community of existence
obtains in this correlation. It would be impossible to
claim that this community was anything corporeal.
If then it be corporeal, it must exist either within the
very subjects, or without them. If such a habituation
be identical among all, it is a synonym. If it be a
habituation which differs according to the subjects in
which it exists, it is a homonym; for the mere name of
"habituation" (in different things) does not always
correspond to the existence of any genuine similarity.
Should we then divide the habituations into two
classes, recognizing that certain objects have an inert
and inactive habituation, implying simultaneity of existence,
and that other objects have a habituation
always implying "potentiality" and "actualization," so
that before "actualizing" the "potentiality" be already
ready to exert itself, and to pass from "potentiality"
to "actualization" in the approximation of relative
conditions? Must we assert that in general certain
things actualize, while others limit themselves to existing?
Must we also assert that that which limits itself
to existence only gives its correlative a name, while
that which actualizes gives it existence? Of this latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_850" id="Page_850">850</a></span>
kind of things are the father and son, the "active" and
"passive," for such things exert a kind of life and
action. Must we then divide habituation in several
kinds, not as possessing something similar and common
in the differences, but as having a nature different in
each member of the division, and thus constituting a
"homonym" (or, mere verbal label)? In this case,
we would apply to the active habituation the names
of "doing" and "suffering," because both imply an
identical action. Further, we will have to posit another
"habituation" which, without itself actualizing,
implies something which acts in two relative terms.
For example, there is equality; which equates two objects;
for it is equality which renders things equal, just
as identity makes them identical; just as the names
"great" and "small" are derived one from the presence
of greatness, and the other from that of smallness.
But if we should consider greatness and smallness in
the individuals which participate therein, it must be
acknowledged that such individual is greater by the
act of greatness which manifests in him, and that another
is smaller because of the inherent act of littleness.</p>

<h3>HABITUATIONS ARE REASONS THAT PARTICIPATE
IN FORMS.</h3>

<p>9. It must therefore be granted that in the things
of which we first spoke, such as knowing and doing
(active being), there is an actualization, an habituation,
and an actualizing reason; while in the other
things there is a participation in form and reason. For
indeed, if the bodies were the only essences, the relative
habituations would bear no reality. If, on the
contrary, we assign the first rank in existence to incorporeal
things, and to the reasons, and if we define
the habituations as reasons that participate in the
forms, we should say that what is double has the
double for its cause, and what is half, has the half as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_851" id="Page_851">851</a></span>
its cause; and that other things are what they are
named because of the presence of the same, or of the
contrary form. Now either two things simultaneously
receive one the double, and the other the half, and one
greatness, and the other smallness; or contraries such
as resemblance and dissimilarity are to be found in
each thing, as well as identity and difference; and
everything finds itself simultaneously similar and dissimilar,
identical and different. It might be objected
that if one object were ugly, and another uglier still,
they are such because they participate in a form. Not
so; for if these two objects be equally ugly, they are
equal in the absence of the form. If they be unequally
ugly, the least ugly is such because it participates in
a form which does not sufficiently subdue matter, and
the uglier is such because it participates in a form which
does so still less. They could, besides, be judged from
the standpoint of deprivation, comparing them to each
other as if they contained some form. The sensation
is a form that results from two things (of that which
feels, and that which is felt); so also with knowledge.
In respect to the thing possessed, possession is an act
which contains, which has a kind of efficacy. As to
mensuration, which is an actualization of measure, in
respect of the measured object, it consists in a reason.</p>

<h3>WHILE SOME ARISTOTELIAN CATEGORIES ARE
LOGICALLY POSSIBLE, THE OBJECTS SUBSUMED
ARE IMPOSSIBLE.</h3>

<p>If then, considering the constitution of the relative
relations as a generic form, it be admitted that it constitutes
an unity, it forms a classification; consequently
it constitutes an existence and a form in all things. But
if the reasons (or, relations) be opposed to each other,
if the above-mentioned differences obtain among them,
they do not constitute a class, and everything must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_852" id="Page_852">852</a></span>
reduced to a resemblance, or category. Now, even if
we admit that the things of which we have spoken can
be reduced to a unity, it does not follow that all the
things gathered under the same category by the Aristotelians,
could be reduced to a single sort. Indeed,
they lump together into the same classification, both
objects and mere statements of their absence, as well
as the objects which derive their appellation from them;
as, for instance, doubleness itself, and the double object.
Now how is it possible to reduce to the same classification
both a thing and the mere lack of it, as, for instance,
doubleness and the non-double, the relative and
the non-relative? This is as absurd as it would be to
gather into the same classification the living "being,"
and the non-living "being." Worse yet, how could
one assort together duplication and the double object,
whiteness and the white object? Such things could
not possibly be identical.</p>

<h3>3. <span class="locked">QUALITIES.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></span></h3>

<p>10. We are now to consider quality, on account of
which a being is said to be "such." What can be the
nature of this quality that it exerts the power of deciding
of the phenomena of objects? Is there a same,
single quality which is something common to all qualities,
and which, by its differences, forms classifications?
Or are the qualities so different that they could not
constitute one and the same classification? What is
there in common between capacity and <span class="locked">disposition<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></span>
(that is, the physical power), the affective quality, the
figure, and the exterior form?<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<h3>THE LACK OF POWERS CANNOT BE SUBSUMED
UNDER THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE POWERS.</h3>

<p>What shall be said of thickness and thinness, of fatness
and leanness? If the element common to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_853" id="Page_853">853</a></span>
conceptions be a power belonging to the capacities, dispositions,
and physical powers, which gives to each
object the power it possesses, the statements of the
absence of power will no longer be classified along
with (the powers). Besides, in what sense can we call
the figure and form of each thing a "power?" Further,
essence would have been deprived of all powers
that were essential, retaining only those it might have
received. Then, quality would comprehend all actualizations
of the beings, which, properly, are actualizations
only so far as they act spontaneously; and also
all actualizations of these properties, but only so far
as they really exist. But quality consists in (unessential)
powers (such as habituations and dispositions)
classified below <span class="locked">beings.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></span> For instance, boxing ability
does not belong among necessary human qualifications,
such as rational functions. The latter would not be
called a quality (as we would speak of boxing ability);
and reasoning would be considered a quality only
figuratively.</p>

<h3>MERE DIFFERENTIALS OF BEINGS ARE NOT
GENUINE QUALITIES.</h3>

<p>A quality is therefore a power which adds (essential)
characteristics to already existing beings. These characteristics
which differentiate beings can therefore be
called qualities only figuratively. Qualities are, rather,
actualizations and reasons, or parts of reasons, which
proclaim the "whatness," though the latter seem to
qualify being. As to the qualities which really deserve
this name, which "qualify" things, which we generally
call "potentialities," they are the reasons and shapes,
either of the soul or the body, such as beauty or
ugliness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_854" id="Page_854">854</a></span><a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></p>

<h3>NOT ALL QUALITIES ARE REASONS.</h3>

<p>How can all qualities be potentialities? It is easy
to see that beauty and health are qualities. But how
could ugliness and sickness, weakness and general impotence,
be qualities? Is it because they qualify certain
things? But what hinders the qualified things
from being called such by mere nomenclature, as
homonyms, and not because of a single (all-sufficient)
reason? Besides, what would hinder them from being
considered not only according to one of the four
<span class="locked">modes,<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></span> but even after each one of the four, or at
least after any two of them? First, the quality does
not consist in "acting" and <span class="locked">"experiencing";<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></span> so that
it is only by placing oneself at different viewpoints
that one could call what "acts" and "experiences" a
quality, in the same sense as health and sickness, disposition
and habitude, force and weakness. Thus power
is no longer the common element in these qualities, and
we shall have to seek something else possessing this
characteristic, and the qualities will no longer all be
reasons. How indeed could a sickness, become a
habituation, or be a reason?</p>

<h3>QUALITY IS NOT A POWER BUT DISPOSITION,
FORM AND CHARACTER.</h3>

<p>Shall the affections which consist in the forms and
powers, and their contraries, the privations, be called
qualities?<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> If so, one kind will no longer exist; and
we shall have to reduce these things to a unity, or
category; that is why knowledge is called a form and
a power, and ignorance a privation and impotence.
Must we also consider impotence and sickness a form,
because sickness and vice can and do accomplish many
things badly? Not so, for in this case he who missed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_855" id="Page_855">855</a></span>
his aim would be exerting a power. Each one of these
things exerts its characteristic activity in not inclining
towards the good; for it could not do what was not
in its power. Beauty certainly does have some power;
is it so also with triangularity? In general, quality
should not be made to consist in power, but rather in
the disposition, and to consider it as a kind of form
of character. Thus the common element in all qualities
is found to be this form, this classification, which
no doubt is inherent in being, but which certainly is
derivative from it.</p>

<h3>QUALITY CONSISTS IN A NON-ESSENTIAL
CHARACTER.</h3>

<p>What part do the powers (or, potentialities) play
here? The man who is naturally capable of boxing
owes it to a certain disposition. It is so also with
somebody who is unskilful in something. In general,
quality consists in a non-essential characteristic; what
seems to contribute to the being, or to add to it, as
color, whiteness, and color in general, contributes to
the beings as far as it constitutes something distinct
therefrom, and is its actualization; but it occupies a
rank inferior to being; and though derived therefrom,
it adds itself thereto as something foreign, as an image
and adumbration.</p>

<h3>UGLY QUALITIES ARE IMPERFECT REASONS.</h3>

<p>If quality consist in a form, in a character and a
reason, how could one thus explain impotence and
ugliness? We shall have to do so by imperfect
reasons, as is generally recognized in the case of <span class="locked">ugliness.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></span>
But how can a "reason" be said to explain
sickness? It contains the reason of health, but somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_856" id="Page_856">856</a></span>
altered. Besides, it is not necessary to reduce
everything to a reason; it is sufficient to recognize, as
common characteristic, a certain disposition foreign to
being, such that what is added to being be a quality
of the subject. Triangularity is a quality of the subject
in which it is located, not by virtue of its triangularity,
but of its location in this subject, and of enduing
it with its form. Humanity has also given to
man his shape, or rather, his being.</p>

<h3>THERE IS ONLY ONE KIND OF QUALITY; OF WHICH
CAPACITY AND DISPOSITION PARTAKE.</h3>

<p>11. If this be so, why should we recognize several
kinds of qualities? Why should we distinguish capacity
and disposition? Whether quality be durable or
not, it is always the same; for any kind of a disposition
is sufficient to constitute a quality; permanence,
however, is only an accident, unless it should be held
that simple dispositions are imperfect forms, and that
capacities are perfect forms. But if these forms be
imperfect, they are not qualities; if they be already
qualities, permanence is but an accident.</p>

<h3>PHYSICAL POWERS DO NOT FORM A SECONDARY
KIND OF QUALITY.</h3>

<p>How can physical powers form a secondary kind of
qualities? If they be qualities only so far as they are
powers, this definition would not suit all qualities, as
has been said above. If boxing ability be a quality
as far as it is a disposition, it is useless to attribute to
it a power, since power is implied in habituation.
Further, how should we distinguish the natural boxing
ability from that which is scientifically acquired? If
both be qualities, they do not imply any difference
so far as one is natural, and the other acquired; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_857" id="Page_857">857</a></span>
is merely an accident, since the capacity of boxing is
the same form in both cases.</p>

<h3>THE DERIVATION OF QUALITIES FROM AFFECTION
IS OF NO IMPORTANCE.</h3>

<p>What does it matter that certain qualities are derived
from an affection, and that others are not derived
therefrom? The origin of qualities contributes
nothing to their distinction or difference. If certain
qualities be derived from an affection, and if others
do not derive therefrom, how could they be classified
as one kind? If it be said that some imply "experiencing"
while others imply "action," they can both
be called qualities merely by similarity of appellation
(homonymy).</p>

<h3>SHAPE IS NOT A QUALITY; BUT SPECIFIC
APPEARANCE, OR REASON.</h3>

<p>What could be said of the shape of every thing?
If we speak of the shape as far as something has a
specific form, that has no regard to quality; if it be
spoken of in respect to beauty or ugliness, together
with the form of the subject, we there have a reason.</p>

<h3>ARISTOTLE WAS WRONG IN CALLING "ROUGH,"
"UNITED," "RARE," AND "DENSE" QUALITIES.</h3>

<p>As to rough, united, rare and <span class="locked">dense<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></span> these could
not be called qualities; for they do not consist only
in a relative separation or reapproximation of the parts
of a body, and do not proceed everywhere from the
inequality or equality of position; if they did, they
might be regarded as qualities. Lightness and weight,
also, could be correctly classified, if carefully studied.
In any case, lightness is only a verbal similarity (a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_858" id="Page_858">858</a></span>
"homonym") unless it be understood to mean diminution
of weight. In this same class might also be found
leanness and slimness, which form a class different
from the four preceding ideas.</p>

<h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF QUALITY.</h3>

<p>12. What other scheme of analysis of quality could
we find, if the above were declared unsatisfactory?
Must we distinguish first the qualities of the soul from
those of the body, and then analyse the latter according
to the senses, relating them to sight, hearing, taste,
smell and touch?</p>

<p>To begin with, how can the qualities of the soul be
divided? Will they be related to the faculty of desire,
to anger, or reason? Will they be divided according
to their suitable operations, or according to their useful
or harmful character? In this case, would we
distinguish several ways of being useful or harmful?
Should we then likewise divide the properties of the
bodies according to the difference of their effects, or
according to their useful or harmless character, since
this character is a property of quality? Surely; to be
useful or harmful seems to be the property of both
the quality, and the thing qualified. Otherwise, we
should have to seek some other classification.</p>

<h3>RELATION BETWEEN THE THING QUALIFIED AND
THE QUALITY.</h3>

<p>How can the thing qualified by a quality refer to the
quality? This must be studied, because the thing qualified
and the quality do not belong to a common kind.
If the man capable of boxing be related to the quality,
why should not the same quality obtain between the
active man and activity? If then the active man be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_859" id="Page_859">859</a></span>
something qualified, "activity" and "passivity" should
not be referred to relation. It would seem preferable to
relate the active man to the quality if he be active by
virtue of a power, for a power is a quality; but if the
power be essential, in so far as it is a power, it is not
something relative, nor even something qualified. We
should not consider that activity corresponds to increase;
for the increase, so far as it increases, stands
in relation only to the less; while activity is such by
itself. To the objection that activity, so far as it is
such, is something qualified, it might be answered that,
at the same time, as far as it can act on something else,
and that it is thus called active, it is something relative.
In this case the man capable of boxing and the art
of boxing itself must be in relation. For the art of
boxing implies a relation; all the knowledge it imparts
is relative to something else. As to the other arts, or
at least, as to the greater number of other arts, it may,
after examination, be said that they are qualities, so
far as they give a disposition to the soul; as far as
they act, they are active, and, from this standpoint,
they refer to something else, and are relative; and
besides, they are relative in the sense that they are
habituations.</p>

<h3>ACTIVITY DOES NOT ALTER THE QUALITY.</h3>

<p>Will we therefore have to admit that activity, which
is activity only because it is a quality, is something
substantially different from quality? In animated
beings, especially in those capable of choice because
they incline towards this or that thing, activity has a
really substantial nature. What is the nature of the
action exercised by the inanimate powers that we call
qualities? Is it participation in their qualities by whatever
approaches them? Further, if the power which
acts on something else simultaneously experiences (or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_860" id="Page_860">860</a></span>
"suffers"), how can it still remain active? For the
greater thing, which by itself is three feet in size, is
great or small only by the relation established between
it, and something else (smaller). It might indeed be
objected that the greater thing and the smaller thing
become such only by participation in greatness or
smallness. Likewise, what is both "active" and "passive"
becomes such in participating in "activity" and
"passivity."</p>

<h3>ARE THE SENSE-WORLD AND THE INTELLIGIBLE
SEPARATE, OR CLASSIFIABLE TOGETHER?</h3>

<p>Can the qualities seen in the sense-world, and those
that exist in the intelligible world, be classified together
in one kind? This question demands an answer
from <span class="locked">those<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></span> who claim that there are also qualities
in the intelligible world. Should it also be asked of
those who do not admit of the existence on high of
kinds, but who limit themselves to attributing some
habit to Intelligence? It is evident that Wisdom exists
in Intelligence; if this Wisdom be homonymous
(similar in name only) with the wisdom which we
know here below, it is not reckoned among sense-things;
if, on the contrary it be synonymous (similar in
nature also) with the wisdom which we know here
below, quality would be found in intelligible entities,
as well as in sense-things (which is false); unless indeed
it be recognized that all intelligible things are
essences, and that thought belongs among them.</p>

<p>Besides, this question applies also to the other
categories. In respect to each of them it might be
asked whether the sensible and the intelligible form
two different kinds, or belong to a single classification.</p>

<h3 class="large">4. WHEN.</h3>

<p>13. As to the category of time, "when," the following
thoughts are suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_861" id="Page_861">861</a></span></p>

<h3>IF TIME BE A QUANTITY; WHY SHOULD "TIME
WHEN" FORM A SEPARATE CATEGORY?</h3>

<p>If to-morrow, to-day, and yesterday, as well as other
similar divisions of time, be parts of time, why should
they not be classed in the same classification as time
itself, along with the ideas "it has been," "it is," and
"it will be?" As they are kinds of time, it seems
proper that they should be classified along with time
itself. Now time is part of quantity. What then is
the use of another category? If the Aristotelians say
that not only "it has been" and "it will be" are time-concepts,
but "yesterday" and "formerly," which are
varieties of "there has been" are also time-concepts
(for these terms are subordinated to "there has been"),
that it is not only "now" that is time, but that "when"
is such also, they will be forced to answer as follows:
First, if "when" be time, time exists; then, as "yesterday"
is past time, it will be something composite, if the
past be something else than time; we will have to
erect two categories, not merely a simple category.
For instance, they say both that "when" is in time,
without being time, and say that "when" is that which
is in time. An example of this would be to say that
Socrates existed "formerly," whereby Socrates would
really be outside of (present) time. Therefore they
are no longer expressing something single. But what
is meant by Socrates "being in time," and that some
fact "is in time?" Does it mean that they are "part
of time?" If, in saying "a part of time," and "so far
as it is a part of time," the Aristotelians believe that
they are not speaking of time absolutely, but only of
a past part of time, they are really expressing several
things. For this "part," so far as it is a part, is by
them referred to something; and for them the past
will be some thing added (to Time), or it will become
identified with "there has been," which is a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_862" id="Page_862">862</a></span>
time. But if they say that there is a difference, because
"there has been" is indeterminate, while "formerly"
and "yesterday" are determinate, we shall be
deciding something about "there has been;" then
"yesterday" will be the determination of "there has
been," so that "yesterday" will be determined time.
Now, that is a quantity of time; so that if time be a
quantity, each one of these two things will be a determined
quantity. But, if, when they say "yesterday"
they mean thereby that such an event has happened in
a determined past time, they are still expressing several
things. Therefore, if some new category is to be introduced
whenever one thing acts in another, as here
happened of what occurred in time, we might have to
introduce many additional categories, for in a different
thing the action is different. This will, besides, become
clearer in what is to follow on the category of
place.</p>

<h3 class="large">5. WHERE, OR, PLACE.</h3>

<h3>IF "WHERE" AND "PLACE" ARE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES,
MANY MORE MIGHT BE ADDED.</h3>

<p>14. The Aristotelians (while treating of this category)
say, Where? For instance, "to the Lyceum,"
or, "to the Academy." The Academy and the Lyceum
are then places and parts of places, as the "top,"
the "bottom," and "here" are parts or classes of place.
The only difference consists in a greater determination.
If then the top, the bottom, and the middle be places,
as, for instance, "Delphi is the middle of the earth,"
and, "the Lyceum and other countries are near the
middle of the earth," what else but place do we have to
seek, since we have just said that each of these things
denotes a place? If, when we say "where?" we assert
that one thing is in another place, we are not expressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_863" id="Page_863">863</a></span>
something single and simple. Besides, each time
that we affirm that such a man is there, we are creating
a double relation, namely, the relation of the man who
is there, with the place where he is, and the relation
of the containing place and the contained man. Why
therefore should we not reduce this to the class of
relations, since the relation of both terms with each
other produces something? Besides, what is the difference
between "here" and "at Athens?" The Aristotelians
grant that "here" indicates the place; consequently,
the same is true of "in Athens." If, "in
Athens" be equivalent to "being in Athens," this latter
expression contains two categories, that of place, and
that of being. Now, this should not be the case; for
as one should not say "Quality exists," but only,
"quality." Besides, if being in place and being in time
presuppose categories other than place and time, why
would "being in a vase" not also constitute a separate
category? Why would it not be so with "being in
matter," with "being in the subject," and in general
of a part "being in the whole," or the "whole in the
parts," the "genus in the species," and the "species in
the genus?" In this manner we would have a far
greater number of categories.</p>

<h3 class="large">6. ACTION AND EXPERIENCING?<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></h3>

<p>The subject of action gives rise to the following
considerations.</p>

<h3>ACTUALIZATION A FAR BETTER CATEGORY THAN
DOING OR ACTING.</h3>

<p>15. The Aristotelians hold that number and quantity,
and other things referring to being should be
subordinated to being; thus they classify quantity as
in a genus different from being. Quality also refers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_864" id="Page_864">864</a></span>
to being, it also is erected into a separate genus. Consequently,
as action also refers to being, it is also considered
a separate genus. Must then "acting," or
rather "action," from which "acting" is derived, be
considered a separate genus, as we consider that quality,
from which qualification is derived, is a separate
genus? (As to these derivations), it might be asked
whether there were no distinction between "action,"
"to act," and "active," or between "to act," and
"action?" "To act" expresses the idea of "active,"
while "action" does not express it. "To act" means
"to be in some action;" or rather, "in actualization."
Consequently, "actualization" expresses a category
rather than "action;" since actualization is predicated
of being, like quality, as was said above; and actualization,
like movement, also relates to being; but movement
necessarily constitutes a class of essence. How
indeed could we admit that quantity, quality and relation
each form a genus, in respect to being, and yet
refuse to movement, which equally refers to being, the
privilege of also forming a genus of being?</p>

<h3>HOW CAN MOVEMENT BE IN TIME, IF CHANGE BE
OUTSIDE OF TIME?</h3>

<p>16. It may be objected that movement is an imperfect
<span class="locked">actualization.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></span> In that case actualization
should be given the first rank; and under that genus
would follow the species of movement, with the quality
of imperfection, by saying that movement is an
actualization, and adding (the specific difference) that
it is imperfect. To say that movement is an imperfect
actualization does not deprive it of being an actualization,
but implies that though it be actualization, there
is in it succession, not to arrive at being actualization,
(which it is already), but to accomplish something
from which it is yet entirely distinct. Then (when that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_865" id="Page_865">865</a></span>
goal is reached), it is not the movement that becomes
perfect, but the thing which was the goal. For instance,
walking is walking from the very first step;
but if there be a mile to go, and the mile be not yet
finished, what is lacking of the mile is not lacking to
the walking or to movement (taken absolutely), but
to that particular walk. For the walk was walking
and movement from the very first step; consequently,
he who is moving has already moved, and he who cuts
has already <span class="locked">cut.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></span> Just as actualization, movement
has no need of time; it needs time only to become such
an action. If then actualization be outside of time,
movement, taken absolutely, must also be outside of
time. The objection that movement is in time because
it implies continuity (proves too much; for in that
case) intuition itself, if prolonged, would also imply
continuity, and therefore would be in time. Reasoning
by induction, it may be seen, 1, that one can always
distinguish parts in any kind of movement; 2, that it
would be impossible to determine when and since when
the movement began, or to assign the definite point of
departure; 3, that it is always possible to divide movement
by following it up to its origin, so that in this
manner movement that has just begun would find itself
to have begun since infinite time, and, 4, that movement
would be infinite in regard to its beginning. The
fact is that the Aristotelians distinguish movement
from actualization; they affirm that actualization is
outside of time, but that time is necessary to movement;
not indeed to some particular movement, but to
movement in itself, because, according to their views,
it is a quantity. Nevertheless, they themselves acknowledge
that movement is a quantity only by accident,
as, for instance, when it is a daily movement,
or when it has some particular duration. Just as
actualization is outside of time, nothing hinders movement
from having begun outside of time, and time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_866" id="Page_866">866</a></span>
from being connected with movement only because
the movement has a certain duration. Indeed, it is
generally granted that changes occur outside of time,
for it is usual to say, The changes occur either suddenly
or successively. Now if change can occur outside
of time, why should it not be so also with movement?
We here speak of change, and not of "having
changed;" for change does not necessarily have to be
accomplished (while "having changed" signifies an
accomplished fact, and consequently implies the notion
of time).</p>

<h3>ACTION AND EXPERIENCING MAY BE SUBSUMED
UNDER MOVEMENT, BUT CANNOT BE CONSIDERED
AS SEPARATE CATEGORIES.</h3>

<p>17. It may be objected that actualization and
movement do not, by themselves, form a genus, but
belong to the genus of relation, because actualization
exists through the power of something active, and
movement exists by the power of some motor, as such.
We might answer that relative conceptions are produced
by habituation (the manner of being) even of
things, and not only through the relation established
between them by the mind. As the habituation is a
mode of "hypostatic" existence, although it be the
"thing of something else," or although it refer to something
<span class="locked">else,<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></span> it nevertheless possesses its nature before
being a relation. Now this actualization, this movement,
this habituation, which is the "thing of some
other thing" nevertheless possesses the property of
existing and of being conceived by itself before being
a relation; otherwise, all things would be relative conceptions;
for there is nothing, not excluding the soul
herself, which does not bear some relation to something
else. Moreover, why are "action" and "acting"
not relatives? For they necessarily are either a movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_867" id="Page_867">867</a></span>
or an actualization. If the Aristotelians consider
"action" a relative, and make a genus of "acting,"
why then do they not also place "movement" among
the relatives, and make a genus of "moving?" They
might, indeed, have subsumed under the genus "movement"
the two species "action" and "reaction" (or,
"suffering"); but they have no right to make two
distinct genera of "acting" and "reacting," as they
generally do.</p>

<h3>ON ARISTOTELIAN PRINCIPLES, EVEN INTELLECTION
WOULD BE MOVEMENT OR ACTUALIZATION.</h3>

<p>18. We must further examine if the Aristotelians
have the right to say that acting contains both actualizations
and movements, the actualizations producing
themselves instantaneously, and the movements successively;
as, for instance, dividing implies time. Or
will they say that all actualizations are movements,
or, at least, are accompanied by movements? Will
they trace all actions to "experiencing" (or, reactions),
or will they acknowledge absolute actions,
like walking or speaking? Or will they distinguish all
actions that relate to "experiencing" as movements,
and all absolute actions as actualizations? Or will
they place actions of both kinds among movements,
and among actualizations? They would no doubt
classify walking, which is an absolute thing, as movement;
and thinking, which is a verb without passive
voice, as an <span class="locked">actualization.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></span> Otherwise the Aristotelians
will be obliged to insist that there is nothing active
in walking or thinking. But if walking and thinking
do not belong to the category of acting, it will be
necessary to explain to what they do belong. Will
it be said that thinking relates to the thinkable (the
intelligible), as intellection <span class="locked">does,<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></span> because sensation
relates to the sense-object? If sensation be related<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_868" id="Page_868">868</a></span>
to the sense-object, why do they not equally relate
"sensing" (feeling) to the sense-object? Sensation,
relating to something else, has a relation with that
thing; but, besides that relation, it has the property of
being an "action" or an "experience" (or, reaction).
If therefore reaction (or, suffering), besides belonging
to something else, or depending on something else,
has the property of itself being something, like actualization,
then walking, besides belonging to something
else (to the feet), and depending on something else
(on the motive power), nevertheless by itself possesses
the property of being movement. In this case,
it will have to be recognized that intellection, besides
being a relation, by itself also is a movement or an
actualization.</p>

<h3>DO CERTAIN ACTIONS APPEAR IMPERFECT WHEN
NOT JOINED TO TIME?</h3>

<p>19. Let us now examine if certain actualizations
seem to be imperfect when they are not joined to
time, thus identifying themselves with movements, as
life identifies itself with living. For (according to the
Aristotelians) the life of each (being) is accomplished
in a perfect time, and happiness is an actualization;
not an individual one, indeed, but a sort of <span class="locked">movement.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></span>
Consequently we will have to call life and
happiness movements, and movement will have to be
made a genus, though recognizing that movement
forms a genus very different from quantity and quality;
and, like them, relates to being. This genus could
be divided into two species, movements of body and
movements of soul, or movements spontaneous and
communicated; or again, movements proceeding from
the beings themselves, or movements proceeding from
others. In this case, the movements proceeding from
the beings themselves are actions, whether they communicate
to others, or remain absolute in themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_869" id="Page_869">869</a></span>
(and not communicating to others, like speaking and
walking); and the movements proceeding from others
are "reactions" though the communicated movements
seem to be identical with the movements proceeding
from others. For example, division is one and the
same thing, whether it be considered within him who
divides, or in that which is divided; nevertheless dividing
is something different from being divided. Or
again, division is not one and the same thing according
as it proceeds from him who divides, or as it is received
by him who is divided; to divide means to cause in the
divided thing another movement, which is the result
of the dividing action or movement. Perhaps, indeed,
the difference does not lie in the very fact of being
divided, but in the movement which results from the
division, as for instance, in suffering; for this is what
constitutes reaction (or "passion").</p>

<p>What are we to say if there be no suffering? We
might answer that the actualization of him who acts
is simply present in such a thing (without correlative
reaction). There are thus two manners of acting; to
act within oneself, and to act outside of oneself. No
more will it then be said that the first mode is proper
acting, and the second reacting, but that there are two
ways of acting outside of oneself, acting and reacting.
For instance, writing is an operation in which one acts
on something else without a correlative reaction, because
in writing one produces nothing but the very
actualization of writing, and not something else, like
experiencing; for the quality of writing that has been
produced is nothing that reacts (or, experiences). As
to walking, though the earth be stepped on by the feet,
it does not react (or, experience) as a consequence.
On the contrary, if it be the body of an animal that is
trod under feet, it may be conceived that there is reaction,
because one then thinks of the suffering endured
by the animal thus trod on, and not of the walking;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_870" id="Page_870">870</a></span>
otherwise, this reaction would have been conceived
before (the notion of this reaction would have been
implied in the very notion of walking).</p>

<h3>ACTION AND REACTION FORM BUT A SINGLE GENUS.</h3>

<p>Thus, in everything, acting forms but a single genus
along with reacting, which (by the Aristotelians) is
considered its opposite. Reacting is what follows
acting, without being its contrary; to be burnt, for instance,
follows burning, but is not its contrary. In
this case, the reaction is what results in the object
itself from the fact of burning, or of being burnt, which
form but one (process), whether the result be suffering,
or something else, as, for instance, depreciation.
It might be objected, When one (being) makes another
suffer, is it not true that the one acts, and the other
reacts? Here from a single actualization result two
facts, an action, and a reaction. Besides, it is not
necessary to include in the action the will to cause
suffering; it has only produced something else as a
result of which it causes suffering, something which
occurring in the being that suffers, and being one single
(occurrence), that causes suffering. What then is
this one identical thing which is anterior to the suffering?
When there is no suffering, is there not nevertheless
a reaction in him in whom is the modification?
For instance, in him who hears? No: to hear is not
to react, and sensation is not really a <span class="locked">reaction;<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></span> but
to suffer is to experience a reaction, and the reaction
is not the contrary of the action (in the sense we have
explained).</p>

<h3>REACTIONS NEED NOT BE PASSIVE, BUT MAY BE
ACTIVE.</h3>

<p>20. Let it be granted, then, that reaction is not
the contrary of action. Nevertheless, as it differs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_871" id="Page_871">871</a></span>
therefrom, it could not share the same genus. If both
reaction and action be movements, they share the
same genus, that of alteration, which is a movement,
as respects <span class="locked">quality.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></span> When alteration proceeds from
the being endowed with quality, is there any action,
though this being remain impassible? Yes, for though
impassible, it is active. It may be asked, is this being
no longer active when it acts on some other object,
as, for instance, by striking it, and then reacts? The
answer is, that it would be active and passive simultaneously.
If it be active, when it reacts&mdash;when, for
instance, it rubs&mdash;why is it considered active rather
than passive? Because it reacts in being rubbed while
it rubs. Could we say that, because it is moved while
moving, there were in it two movements? But how
could there be two movements in it? Shall we assert
that there is but one? In this case, how could the
same movement be action and reaction simultaneously?
Doubtless, it will be considered action, in so
far as it proceeds from the mover; and reaction, inasmuch
as it passes from the mover into the moved;
and this, without ceasing to be one and the same thing.
Would you say that reaction was a movement of a
kind different from action? How then would the
altering movement in a certain manner modify what
reacts without an equal reaction in what is acting?
But how (can we conceive) of reaction in that which
acts on another object? Is the mere presence of the
movement in the moved sufficient to constitute reaction?<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a>
But if, on one hand, the ("seminal) reason"
of the swan whitens, and on the other hand the swan
that is being born becomes white, shall we say that the
swan is passive in becoming what it is his nature to
be? If he becomes white even after his birth, is he
still passive? If one thing increase, and another
thing be increased, will we admit that the thing that
increases reacts? Will we rather attribute reaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_872" id="Page_872">872</a></span>
to the thing qualified? If one thing be embellished,
and another thing embellishes it, could we say that
the embellished thing reacts?<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> If however, the embellishing
thing decreases, and, like tin, tarnishes, or
on the contrary, like copper, takes on polish; shall
we say that the tin acts, and the copper reacts (that
is, "suffers")? Besides, it would be impossible to say
that that which learns is passive (suffering)? Would
this be because the action of him who acts passes into
him? But how could there be any reaction ("suffering")
since there is nothing there but an act? This
action, no doubt, is not a reaction ("suffering"); but
he who receives it is passive, because he participates
in passivity. Indeed, from the fact that the learner
does not himself act, it does not necessarily result that
he is passive; for learning is not being struck, but
grasping and discerning, as takes place with the process
of vision.</p>

<h3>DEFINITION OF REACTION OR SUFFERING.</h3>

<p>21. How may we define the fact of "reaction"?
We do not approve of the definition that it is the
passing of the actualization from one being into another,
if its receiver appropriate it. Shall we say
that a (being) reacts when there is no actualization,
but only an effective experience? But is it not possible
that the being that reacts becomes better; while,
on the contrary, the one who acts, loses? A (being)
may also act in an evil manner, and exercise on another
a harmful influence; and the actualization may be
shameful, and the affective experience be honorable.
What distinction shall we then establish (between
action and reaction)? Shall we say that an action is
to cause (an actualization) to pass from self into others,
and that reaction is to receive in oneself (an action)
from someone else? But then what about the (actualizations)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_873" id="Page_873">873</a></span>
produced in oneself which do not pass into
others, such as thought and opinion? One can even
excite oneself by a reflection or opinion of emotive
value, without this emotion having been aroused by
anybody else. We shall therefore define an action as
a spontaneous movement, whether this movement remain
in the being who produces it, or whether it pass
into somebody else.</p>

<p>What then are the faculty of desire, and desire in
general? If desire be excited by the desired thing
(it is an experience, or passion), even if we should
not take into consideration the cause of its excitement,
and even if we only noticed that it arose later than
the object; for this desire does not differ from an impression
or an impulsion.</p>

<p>Shall we then, among desires, distinguish actions
when they proceed from intelligence, and experiences
when they invoke and draw (on the soul), so that the
being be less passive by what it receives from others,
than by what it receives from itself? Doubtless a
being can act upon itself. (We can then define) an
affective experience, and a being's experience, as follows.
They consist of undergoing, without any contribution
from oneself, a modification which does not
contribute to "being," and which, on the contrary,
alters, or at least, does not improve.</p>

<p>To this (definition) it may be objected that if
warming oneself consist in receiving such heat as
partially contributes to the subject's being, and partly
does not do so, then we have here one and the same
thing which both is, and is not an experience. To this
it may be answered that there are two ways of warming
oneself. Besides, even when the heating contributes
to the being, it does so only in the degree that
some other object experiences. For instance, the
metal will have to be heated, and undergo an experience,
for the production of the being called statue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_874" id="Page_874">874</a></span>
although this statue itself be heated only incidentally.
If then the metal become more beautiful by the effect
of that which heats it, or by the effect of the heating
itself, it undergoes an experience; for there are two
manners of (undergoing an experience, or) suffering:
the one consists in becoming worse, and the other in
becoming better&mdash;or at least, in not altering.</p>

<h3>TRANSMISSION, RECEPTION AND RELATION UNDERLIE
ACTION AND EXPERIENCE.</h3>

<p>22. The cause that a being undergoes an experience
is that it contains the kind of movement called
alteration, whichever way it modify him; on the contrary,
action means to have in oneself a definite
movement, derived from oneself, or a movement
which has its goal in some other being, and its origin
in self. In both cases there is movement; but with
this distinction: that action, so far as it is action, is
impassible; while an experience consists in the experiencer's
reception of a disposition new to him,
without the reception of anything that contributes towards
his being; so as to avoid (the case of the statue,
above, where) the experience happened to one being
(the metal), while it was another being that was produced
(the statue). Consequently, the same thing
will in one state be an action, and in other, an experience.
Thus the same movement will in one being
be an action, because it is considered from a certain
viewpoint; and from another it will be an experience,
because it is disposed some other way. Action and
experience seem therefore to be relative, if one consider
the action in its relation with experience, since
the same thing is action in the one, and experience in
the other. Also, because neither of these two can be
considered in itself, but only in him who acts, or experiences,
when the one moves, and the other is moved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_875" id="Page_875">875</a></span>
Each of these terms therefore implies two categories;
one gives the movement, the other receives it; consequently
we have transmission and reception, which
result in relation. If he who received the movement
possesses it as he possesses color, why could it not also
be said that he possessed movement? Absolute movements,
such as walking (and thinking) possess steps
and thought.</p>

<h3>PREDICTION AND RESPONSIVENESS TO IT DO NOT
FALL UNDER DEFINITION FOR ACTION AND
EXPERIENCE.</h3>

<p>Let us now consider whether prediction be an action,
and whether adapting one's course to the prediction of
somebody else would constitute experiencing; for prediction
comes from one being and applies to another.
However, although prediction apply to some other,
we would not consider prediction an action, nor being
directed by the prediction of somebody else an experience.
In general, not even thought is an action;
thought, indeed, does not pass in to the object thought,
but functions within itself; it is not at all an action.
Actualizations are not at all actions, and not all of
them perform actions; indeed, they may do so only
accidentally. It might be objected that a man who
was walking would certainly impress on the ground
the trace of his steps, and would thereby perform an
action. Such an action would be the consequence of
something else, or the man would act accidentally;
and it would be accidental, because the man was not
thinking of it. It is in this way that even inanimate
things perform some action, that fire heats, and medicine
cures. But enough of this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_876" id="Page_876">876</a></span></p>

<h3 class="large">7. POSSESSION.</h3>

<p>23. Let us now examine the category of "having"
(possession).</p>

<h3>HAVING IS SO INDEFINITE AND VARIOUS THAT IT
CANNOT BE A CATEGORY.</h3>

<p>If the verb "to have" be used in several senses,
why might we not apply to this category all the various
uses of the word; for instance, quantity, because
quantity has size; quality, because it has color; the
father, because he has a son; the son, because he has
a father; and, in general, all kinds of possession? Will
it be said that the other things that can be possessed
have already been classified under the categories considered
above, and that the category of "having"
comprises only arms, foot-wear, and clothing? This
might be answered by the question why "having"
these objects should constitute a category, and why
burning them, cutting them, burying them, or throwing
them away, would not equally constitute one or more
categories? If the answer be that all these things form
one category because they refer to the body, this
would then also make another category if we placed
a garment over a litter; or likewise if someone were
covered with clothing. If another answer be that the
category of "having" consists in the "manner of <span class="locked">containing,"<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></span>
and in <span class="locked">possession,<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></span> then all things which
are possessed will have to be reduced to this category,
which will thus contain all possession, whatever it be,
since the nature of the possessed object could not here
prevail to form some distinction. On the other hand,
if the category of "having" must exclude having a
quantity or quality, because the latter ideas already
form their own categories; nor having parts, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_877" id="Page_877">877</a></span>
of the category of being (which includes parts); why
should this category contain having arms, when arms,
as well as foot-wear, belong to the category of being?
In any case, how could the statement, "He has arms"
be considered something simple, which could be reduced
to any one category? That statement expresses
the same idea as "He is armed." Can this expression
("he has arms") refer only to a man, or even to his
statue? The living man possesses very differently
from possession by a statue, and the verb "to have"
is used only as a verbal label (a homonym), just as the
verb "to stand up" would mean something very different
according as it referred to a man or a statue.
Besides, is it reasonable to make a generic category
of some merely incidental characteristic?</p>

<h3 class="large">8. SITUATION.</h3>

<p>24. As to the category of situation, it contains also
such incidental characteristics as being raised, or
seated. Here the Aristotelians do not make a category
of situation, by itself, but of the kind of situation, as
when it is said, "He is placed in such a posture"&mdash;a
phrase in which "to be placed" and "in such a posture"
express two entirely different ideas&mdash;or again, "he is
in such a place." Now, as posture and location have
already been studied, what is the use in here combining
two categories into one? If, on the other hand,
the expression "he is seated" indicate an action or
an experience, must it not then be reduced to the
category of action or experience? It would moreover
amount to the same thing to say "he is raised,"
as to say, "he is situated above;" just as we say he
is situated in the middle, or, he is situated below. Besides,
being seated has already been treated of under
the category of relation; why should, "being raised"
not also be a relative entity, since the category of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_878" id="Page_878">878</a></span>
relation includes the thing to the left, and the thing
to the right, as well as the left and right hand themselves?</p>

<p>Enough of these reflections (about Aristotelian categories).</p>

<h3 class="large">B. CRITICISM OF THE STOIC CATEGORIES.</h3>

<p>25. Let us now pass to the (Stoic) <span class="locked">philosophers<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></span>
who, recognizing four categories only, divide everything
into "substances," "qualities," "modes," and
"relations;" and who, attributing to all (beings) something
common, thus embrace them into a single genus.</p>

<h3>THE CATEGORY OF SOMETHING COMMON IS
ABSURD.</h3>

<p>This doctrine raises a great number of objections,
especially in that it attributes to all beings something
in common, and thus embraces them in a single class.
Indeed, this "something" of which they speak is quite
incomprehensible; as also is how it could adapt itself
equally to bodies and to incorporeal beings, between
which they do not allow for sufficient distinction to
establish a distinction in this "something." Besides,
this something either is, or is not an essence; if it be
an essence, it must be a form; if it be not an essence,
there result a thousand absurdities, among which would
be that essence is not an essence. Let us therefore
leave this point, and devote ourselves to the division
into four categories.</p>

<h3 class="large">1. SUBSTANCE; ACCORDING TO THEM IT IS
SPLIT UP.</h3>

<p>The Stoics assign the first rank to substances, and
place matter before the other substances. From this
it results that the Stoics assign to the same rank their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_879" id="Page_879">879</a></span>
first Principle, and with it the things which are inferior
thereto. First, they reduce to a single class both
anterior and posterior things, though it be impossible
to combine them in this manner. In fact, every time
that things differ from each other in that some are
anterior, and others posterior, those which are posterior
owe their essence to those which are anterior. On
the contrary, when things are comprised within one
and the same class, all equally owe their essence to
this class, since a class is "what is affirmed of kinds of
things in regard to essence." The Stoics themselves
recognize this by saying that all things derive their
essence from matter.</p>

<p>Besides, when they count but a single substance,
they do not enumerate the beings themselves, but they
seek their principles. Now there is a great difference
between treating of principles and treating of beings.
If the Stoics recognize no essence other than matter,
and think that other things are modifications of matter,
they are wrong in reducing essence and other things
to a common class; they should rather say that essence
is being, and that other things are modifications, and
then distinguish between these modifications. Further,
it is absurd to assert that (among essences), some
should be substances, and others should be other things
(such as qualities, modes and relations); for the Stoics
recognize but a single substance, which does not contain
any difference, unless by division as of mass into
parts; besides, they should not attribute divisibility to
their substance, because they teach that it is continuous.
They should therefore say, "substance" (and not
"substances").</p>

<h3>MATTER CANNOT BE THE PRIMARY PRINCIPLE.</h3>

<p>26. What is most shocking in the Stoic doctrine, is
that they assign the first rank to what is only a potentiality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_880" id="Page_880">880</a></span>
matter, instead of placing actualization before
<span class="locked">potentiality.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></span> It is impossible for the potential to pass
to actualization if the potential occupy the first rank
among beings. Indeed, the potential could never improve
itself; and it implies the necessary anteriority of
actualization; in which case potentiality is no longer
a principle. Or, if it be insisted that actualization and
potentiality must be simultaneous, both principles will
be found depending on chance. Besides, even if
actualization be contemporaneous with potentiality,
why should not the first rank be assigned to actualization?
Why should this (matter) be an essence, rather
than those (forms)? Whoever asserts that form is
posterior bears the burden of proof; for matter does
not beget form, and quality could not arise from what
has no quality; nor actualization from what is potential;
otherwise, actualization would have existed anteriorly,
even in the system of the Stoics. According
to them, even God is no longer simple: He is posterior
to matter; for He is a body constituted by form and
<span class="locked">matter.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></span> Whence then does He derive His form?
If the divinity exist without matter, He is incorporeal,
by virtue of His being principle and reason, and the
active principle would thus be incorporeal. If, even
without having matter, the divinity be composite in
essence, by virtue of His body, the Stoics will have to
postulate some other kind of matter which may better
suit the divinity.</p>

<h3>MATTER IS NOT A BODY "WITHOUT QUALITY, BUT
WITH MAGNITUDE" (A STOIC DEFINITION).</h3>

<p>Besides, how could matter be the first Principle, if it
be a body? If the body of which the Stoics speak be
of another nature, then matter can be called a body
only <span class="locked">figuratively.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></span> If they say that the common
property of the body is to have three dimensions, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_881" id="Page_881">881</a></span>
are speaking of the mathematical body. If on the
contrary they join impenetrability to the three dimensions,
they are no more talking about something
simple. Besides, impenetrability is a quality, or is
derived from a quality; but what is the source of impenetrability?
Whence comes tri-dimensional extension?
Who endued matter with extension? Matter,
indeed, is not contained in the idea of tri-dimensional
extension any more than the latter is contained in the
notion of matter. Consequently, since matter thus
participates in <span class="locked">size,<a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></span> it is no longer a "simple" matter.</p>

<h3>ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE PRECEDES CONTINGENT
EXISTENCE.</h3>

<p>Moreover, whence is derived the unification of
matter? Matter is not unity, but it participates in
unity. They would have had to realize that the
material mass is not anterior to everything, and that
the first rank pertains to what is not one mass, to
Unity itself. Then they would have to descend from
Unity to multiplicity, from what is size-less to actual
sizes; since, if size be one, it is not because it is Unity
itself, but only because it participates in unity. We
must therefore recognize that what possesses primary
and absolute existence is anterior to what exists contingently.
But how does contingency itself exist?
What is its mode of existence? If the Stoics had examined
this point, they would have finally hit upon
(the absolute Unity) which is not unity merely contingently.
By this expression is here meant what is
not one by itself, but by others.</p>

<h3>THE STOIC GOD IS ONLY MODIFIED MATTER.</h3>

<p>27. The Stoics did well, indeed, to assign the
principle of everything to the first rank; but they
should not have recognized as principle, and accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_882" id="Page_882">882</a></span>
as "being" what was shapeless, passive, devoid of life
and intelligence, dark, and indefinite. Because of the
universe's beauty, they are forced to introduce within
it a divinity; but the latter derives His very essence
from matter; He is composite and posterior (to matter);
rather, He is no more than "modified <span class="locked">matter."<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></span>
Consequently, if matter be the subject, there must
necessarily be outside of it some other principle
which, acting upon matter, makes of it the subject of
the qualities which He imparts thereto. If this principle
resided in matter, and Himself were the subject;
if, in other words, He were contemporaneous with
matter, He could not reduce matter to the state of a
subject. Now it is entirely impossible (for this principle)
to constitute a subject concurrently with matter;
for in such a case both would have to serve as subject
to something higher; and what could it be, since there
could be no further principle to make a subject of
them, if all things had already been absorbed into this
(concurrent) subject? A subject is necessarily subject
to something; not to what it has in itself, but to that
whose action it undergoes. Now, it undergoes the
action of that which itself is not subject by itself; consequently,
of that which is outside of itself. This point
has evidently been overlooked by the Stoics.</p>

<h3>IF EVERYTHING BE DERIVED FROM MATTER, MATTER
CAN NO LONGER BE THEIR SUBJECT.</h3>

<p>On the other hand, if matter and the active principle
need nothing exterior, if the subject that they
constitute can itself become all things by assuming
different forms, as a dancer, who can assume all possible
attitudes, this subject would no longer be a subject,
but He will be all things. Just as the dancer is
not the subject of the attitudes (for they are his actualizations),
likewise the "matter" of the Stoics will no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_883" id="Page_883">883</a></span>
longer be the subject of all things, if all things proceed
from matter; or rather, the other things will no
longer really exist, they will be nothing but "modified
matter," just as the attitudes are nothing but the
"modified dancer." Now if the other things no longer
really exist, matter is no longer a subject; it is no
longer the matter of the essences, but is matter exclusively.
It will no longer even be matter, because
what is matter must be matter of something; but that
which refers to something else belongs to the same
classification as that thing, just as half belongs to the
same classification as the double, and is not the being
of the double. But how could non-essence, except by
accident, refer to essence? But the absolute Essence
and matter itself refer to essence by virtue of being
essence. Now if that which is to be is a simple potentiality,
it cannot constitute "being," which consequently
matter could not <span class="locked">be.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></span></p>

<h3>THE MONISM OF THE STOICS BREAKS DOWN, JUST
LIKE DUALISM.</h3>

<p>Consequently, the Stoics, who reproach other philosophers
(such as Plato) for making up beings out of
<span class="locked">non-beings,<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></span> themselves make up a non-being out
of a <span class="locked">being.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></span> Indeed (in the system of the Stoics),
the world, such as it is, is not being. It is certainly
unreasonable to insist that matter, which is a subject,
should nevertheless be "being," and that bodies should
not, any more than matter be "being"; but it is still
more unreasonable to insist that the world is "being,"
not by itself, but only by one of its parts (namely,
matter); that the organism does not owe its being to
the soul, but only to matter; and last, that the soul is
only a modification of matter, and is something
posterior to others. From whom then did matter receive
animation? Whence comes the hypostatic existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_884" id="Page_884">884</a></span>
of the soul? How does, matter receive form?
For, since matter becomes the bodies, the soul is
something else than matter. If the form came from
something else than the soul, quality, on uniting to
matter, would produce not the soul, but inanimate
bodies. If something fashion matter and create the
soul, the created soul would have to be preceded by
a "creating soul."</p>

<h3>THE FAULT OF THE STOICS IS TO HAVE TAKEN
SENSATION AS GUIDE.</h3>

<p>28. The Stoic theory raises numberless further objections;
but we halt here lest we ourselves incur
ridicule in combating so evident an absurdity. It suffices
if we have demonstrated that these philosophers
mistake non-essence for absolute essence; (putting the
cart before the horse), they assign the First rank to
what should occupy the last. The cause of their error
is that they have chosen sensation as guide, and have
consulted nothing else in determining both their principles,
and consequences. Being persuaded that the
bodies are genuine <span class="locked">essences,<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a></span> and refusing to believe
that they transform themselves into each other, they
believed that what subsisted in them (in the midst of
their changes) is the real essence, just as one might
imagine that place, because it is indestructible, is more
essential than (metabolic) bodies. Although in the
system of the Stoics place remain unaltered, these
philosophers should not have regarded as essence that
which subsists in any manner soever; they should, first,
have considered what are the characteristics necessarily
possessed by essence, the presence of which
(characteristics) makes it subsist without undergoing
any alteration. Let us indeed suppose that a shadow
would continuously subsist by following something
which changes continuously; the shadow, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_885" id="Page_885">885</a></span>
would not be no more real than the object it follows.
The sense-world, taken together with its multiple objects,
is more of an essence than the things it contains,
merely because it is their totality. Now if this subject,
taken in its totality, be non-essence, how could it be a
subject? The most surprising thing, however, is that
the (Stoics), in all things following the testimony of
sensation, should not also have affirmed that essence
can be perceived by sensation; for, to matter, they do
not attribute impenetrability, because it is a quality
(and because, according to them, matter has no quality).
If they insist that matter is perceived by <span class="locked">intelligence,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></span>
it could only be an irrational intelligence
which would consider itself inferior to matter, and
attribute to it, rather than to itself, the privilege of
constituting genuine essence. Since in their system
intelligence is non-essence, how could any credibility
attach to that intelligence when it speaks of things
superior to it, and with which it possesses no affinity?
But we have said enough of the nature of these subjects,
<span class="locked">elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></span></p>

<h3 class="large">2. QUALITY.</h3>

<h3>QUALITIES ARE INCORPOREAL.</h3>

<p>29. Since the Stoics speak of qualities, they must
consider these as distinct from subjects; otherwise,
they would not assign them to the second rank. Now,
to be anything else than the subjects, qualities must be
simple, and consequently, not composite; that is, they
must not, in so far as they are qualities, contain any
matter. In this case, the qualities must be incorporeal
and active; for, according to the Stoics, matter is a
passive subject. If, on the contrary, the qualities
themselves be passive, the division into subjects and
qualities is absurd, because it would classify separately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_886" id="Page_886">886</a></span>
simple and composite things, and then reunite them
into one single classification. Further, it is faulty in
that it locates one of the species in another (matter in
the qualities), as if science were divided into two kinds,
of which one would comprise grammar, and the other
grammar with something additional.</p>

<h3>"SEMINAL REASONS," AS QUALIFIED MATTER,
WOULD BE COMPOSITE; AND SECONDARY.</h3>

<p>If the Stoics say that the qualities are "qualified
matter," then their ("seminal) reasons" being not
merely united to nature, but (fully) material, will no
doubt form a composite; but before forming this composite
they themselves will already be composed of
matter and forms; they themselves will therefore be
neither reasons nor forms.</p>

<h3>THE FOUR STOIC CATEGORIES EVAPORATE, LEAVING
MATTER ALONE AS BASIS.</h3>

<p>If the (Stoics) say that the "reasons" are only
modified matter, they then admit that qualities are
modes, and the (Stoics) should locate the reasons in
the fourth category, of relation. If however relation
be something different from modality, in what does
that difference consist? Is it that modality here possesses
greater reality? But if modality, taken in itself,
be not a reality, why then make of it a category?
Surely it would be impossible to gather in a single
category both essence and non-essence. In what then
does this modification of matter consist? It must be
either essence or non-essence. If it be essence, it is
necessarily incorporeal. If it be non-essence, it is
nothing but a word, and matter alone exists. In this
case, quality is nothing real, and modality still less.
As to the fourth category, relation, absolutely no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_887" id="Page_887">887</a></span>
reality whatever will inhere in it. This Stoic system,
therefore, contains nothing else but matter.</p>

<h3>THE CULT OF MATTER IMPLIES IGNORING SOUL
AND INTELLIGENCE.</h3>

<p>But on whose authority do we learn this? Surely,
not on that of matter itself, unless that, because of its
modification, it becomes intelligence; but this (alleged)
modification is but a meaningless addition; it must
therefore be matter which perceives these things, and
expresses them. If we should ask whether matter
utter sensible things, we might indeed ask ourselves
how matter thinks and fulfils the functions of the soul,
although matter lacks both soul and intelligence. If,
on the contrary, matter utter something nonsensical,
insisting that it is what it is not, and what it could not
be, to whom should this silly utterance be ascribed?
Surely only to matter, if it could speak. But matter does
not speak; and he who speaks thus does so only because
he has borrowed much from matter, that he has
become its slave, though he have a soul. The fact
is that he is ignorant of himself, as well as of the
nature of the faculty which can divulge the truth about
this subject (intelligence).</p>

<h3 class="large">3. MODALITY.</h3>

<h3>MODALITY SHOULD NOT OCCUPY EVEN THE THIRD
RANK OF EXISTENCE.</h3>

<p>30. It is absurd to assign the third rank to modalities,
and even assign to them any place whatever; for
all modalities refer to matter. It may however be
objected to this that there are differences between the
modalities; the various modifications that matter
undergoes are not the same thing as the modalities;
the qualities are doubtless modalities of matter, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_888" id="Page_888">888</a></span>
modalities, in the strict sense of the word, refer to
qualities. (The answer to this is that) since the
qualities are only modalities of matter, the technical
modalities mentioned by the (Stoics) themselves reduce
to matter, and necessarily relate thereto. In
view of the many differences obtaining between them,
how otherwise could modalities form a category?
How could one reduce to a single classification the
length of three feet, and whiteness&mdash;since one is a
quantity, and the other a quality? How could time
and place be reduced thereto? Besides, how would
it be possible to consider as modalities such expressions
as "yesterday," "formerly," "in the Lyceum," and,
"in the Academy"? How could time be explained as
a modality? Neither time, nor things which are in
time, nor place, nor the things which are in place,
could be modalities. How is "to act" a modality,
since he who acts is not himself a modality, but rather
acts within some modality, or even, acts simply? Nor
is he who undergoes an experience any more of a
modality; he experiences something rather in a modality,
or rather, he undergoes some experience in such
a manner. Modality rather suits the (Aristotelian)
categories of situation and possession; and as to possession,
no man even possesses "in such or such a
modality," but possesses purely and simply.</p>

<h3 class="large">4. RELATION; THE STOICS CONFUSE THE
NEW WITH THE ANTERIOR.</h3>

<p>31. If the Stoics did not, along with the other discussed
categories, reduce relation to a common kind,
there might be good grounds to examine whether they
attributed substantial (or, hypostatic) reality to these
manners of "being"; for often, they do not attribute
to them any. But what is to be said of their confusing
things new and anterior in one same classification?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_889" id="Page_889">889</a></span>
This is evidently an absurdity; for surely one and two
must exist before the half or the double.</p>

<p>As to the philosophers (Plato, for instance), who
have taught other opinions about essences and their
principles, considered as finite or infinite, corporeal or
incorporeal, or both simultaneously corporeal or incorporeal,
we will examine each of these opinions
separately, considering also the historic objections of
the ancient (philosophers).</p>

<p>1. After having discussed the doctrine of the ten
categories (of Aristotle), and spoken of the (Stoics)
who reduce all things to a single genus, and then distribute
them in four species, we must still set forth
our own opinion on the subject, striving however to
conform ourselves to the doctrine of Plato.</p>

<h3>PLOTINOS IS FORCED TO DEMONSTRATION OF HIS
DIVERGENCE FROM PLATO.</h3>

<p>If it were our opinion that essence was one, we
would not need to study whether there was one single
genus for all things, whether all genera could not be
reduced to a single one; whether there were principles;
whether the genera were at the same time principles;
or whether all principles are genera, without saying
conversely that all genera are principles; or, if we must
distinguish between them, say that some principles are
simultaneously genera, or some genera are principles,
or, finally, whether all principles be genera without
the genera being principles, and conversely. But,
since we do not acknowledge that essence is one, the
<span class="locked">reasons<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></span> for which were advanced by Plato and other
philosophers, we find ourselves forced to treat all
these questions, and first to explain why we recognize
genera of essences, and what number we decide on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_892" id="Page_892">892</a></span></p>

<h3>PLOTINOS ADDS TO ESSENCE ETERNITY, TO MAKE
ESSENCE INTELLIGIBLE.</h3>

<p>As we are going to treat of essence or essences, we
must before everything else clear up the significance
of essence, which we are now considering, and distinguish
it from what other people mean by that word,
which we would more likely call that which becomes,
what is never genuine essence. And besides, it must
be clearly understood that in making this distinction,
we do not intend to divide a genus in species of the
same nature; as Plato tried to <span class="locked">do.<a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></span> For it would be
ridiculous to subsume under the same genus both essence
and non-essence, or Socrates, and the image of
Socrates. The kind of divisions here attempted will
therefore only consist in separating things essentially
different, as, for instance, explaining that apparent
essence is not the same as the veritable Essence, by
demonstrating that the latter's nature is entirely different.
To clarify this its nature, it will be necessary
to add to the idea of essence that of eternity, and thus
to demonstrate that the nature of being could never
be deceptive. It is of this kind of essence (that is, of
the intelligible Essence), that we are going to treat,
admitting that it is not single. <span class="locked">Later<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></span> we shall speak
of generation, of what becomes, and of the sense-world.</p>

<h3>HIERARCHICAL CONSTITUTION OF THE UNIVERSE.</h3>

<p>2. Holding as we do that the world-Essence is
not one, we must face the question whether the number
of beings is determinate, or infinite. To say that
world-Essence is not one, however, is to say that it is
both one and multiple, a varied unity that embraces
a multitude. It is therefore necessary that the One,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_893" id="Page_893">893</a></span>
so conceived, be one so far as it forms a single genus,
containing as species the essences by which it is simultaneously
one and multiple; or there must be several
genera, but that they all be subsumed under the single
one; or again, that there be several genera which however
be not mutually subsumed, of which each, being
independent of the others, may contain what is below
it, consisting of less extended genera, or species below
which there are no more than individuals; so that all
these things may contribute to the constitution of a
single nature, together making up the organization of
the intelligible world, which we call world-Essence
(or "being").</p>

<h3>THE ELEMENTS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE PRINCIPLES
AND GENERA SIMULTANEOUSLY.</h3>

<p>Under these circumstances, the divisions that we
establish are no more only genera, they are simultaneously
the very principles of world-Essence; on the one
hand they are genera, because they contain less extended
genera, beneath which are species, which end
in individuals; they are also principles, because world-Essence
is composed of multiple elements, and because
these elements constitute the totality of Essence.
If it were only stated that world-Essence is composed
of several elements, and that these elements, by co-operation,
constitute the All, without adding that they
branch out into lower species, our divisions would indeed
be principles, but they would no longer be
genera. For instance, if it be said that the sense-world
is composed of four elements, such as fire, or other
elements, these elements are indeed principles, but not
genera, unless this name be used as a verbal similarity
(or, homonym, or pun).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_894" id="Page_894">894</a></span></p>

<h3>BEING ACTUALIZATIONS, BOTH GENERA AND
INDIVIDUALS WILL BE DISTINCT.</h3>

<p>Admitting therefore the existence of certain genera,
which are simultaneously principles, we must still consider
whether they should be conceived so that these
genera, along with the things contained by each of
them, commingle, fuse, and form the whole by
their blending. If so, the genera would exist potentially,
but not in actualization; none would have anything
characteristic. Further, granting the distinctness
of the genera, can we grant that the individuals
blend? But what then would become of the genera
themselves? Will they subsist by themselves, and
will they remain pure, without mutual destruction of
the mingled individuals? Later we shall indicate how
such things could take place.</p>

<h3>FUNDAMENTAL UNITY OF GENERA WOULD DESTROY
SPECIES; MANIFOLDNESS MUST PRE-EXIST.</h3>

<p>Now that we have explained the existence of genera,
which, besides, are principles of being, and that from
another point of view there are principles (or elements),
and compounds, we shall have to set forth
the criterion by which we constitute these genera; we
shall have to ask how they may be distinguished from
each other, instead of reducing them to a single (principle),
as if they had been united by chance, although
it does indeed seem more rational to reduce them to
a single (principle). It would be possible to reduce
them in this way if all things were species of essence,
if the individuals were contained within these species,
and if there were nothing outside of these species. But
such a supposition would destroy the species&mdash;for such
species would no longer be species, or forms;&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_895" id="Page_895">895</a></span>
from that moment there would be no further need for
reducing plurality to unity, and everything forming a
single unity; so that, all things belonging to this One,
no being outside of the One would exist, as far as it
was something else.</p>

<p>How indeed could the One have become manifold,
and how could it have begotten the species, if nothing
but it existed? For it would not be manifold if there
were not something to divide it, such as a size; now
that which divides is other than that which is divided.
The mere fact that it divides itself, or imparts itself
to others, shows that it was already divisible before the
division.</p>

<h3>THERE IS MORE THAN ONE GENUS, FOR NOT EVERYTHING
CAN BE SUBSUMED UNDER BEING AND
ESSENCE.</h3>

<p>For this and other reasons, therefore, we must take
good care to avoid assertion of a single genus; for it
would be impossible to apply to everything the
denominations of "being" and <span class="locked">essence.<a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a></span> If indeed
there be very different objects called essence, this is
only accidentally, just as if one called the color white
a being; for strictly we cannot apply "being" to white,
as considered <span class="locked">alone.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></span></p>

<h3>THE ONE IS SO FAR ABOVE ALL THE GENERA
AS NOT TO BE COUNTED.</h3>

<p>3. We therefore assert the existence of several
genera, and that this plurality is not accidental. These
divers genera, however, depend from the One. But
even though they do depend from the One, if the One
be not something which may be affirmed of each of
them as considered in its being, then nothing hinders
each of them, having nothing similar to the others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_896" id="Page_896">896</a></span>
from constituting a genus apart. We also grant that
the One, existing outside of the genera which are
begotten of Him, is their cause, although the other
essences considered in their being do not proclaim this.
Yes indeed, the One is outside of the other essences.
Besides, He is above them; so much so, that He is not
counted as one of them; for it is through Him that the
other essences exist, which, so far as they are genera,
are equal.</p>

<h3>WE ARE DISCUSSING HERE NOT THE ABSOLUTE
ONE, BUT THE ESSENTIAL RELATED ONE.</h3>

<p>Still, it will be asked, Of what nature is the One
which does not count among the genera? This (absolute
One) is outside of our present consideration;
for we are not studying Him who is above <span class="locked">essence,<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a></span>
but the essences themselves. We must therefore pass
by the absolute One, and seek the one which is counted
among the genera.</p>

<h3>THE RELATED ONE IS IN SOME GENERA, BUT NOT
IN OTHERS.</h3>

<p>To begin with (if we consider the related One from
this point of view), it will seem astonishing to see
the cause numbered along with the effects. It would
indeed be unreasonable to cram into a single genus
both superior and inferior things. If nevertheless, on
counting the one amidst the essences of which He is
the cause, He was to be considered as a genus to which
the other essences were to be subordinated, and from
which they differed; if, besides, the one was not to
be predicated of the other essences either as genus, or
in any other respect, it would still be necessary that
the genera which possessed essence subsume species
under them; since, for instance, by moving, you produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_897" id="Page_897">897</a></span>
walking, and yet walking cannot be considered
a genus subordinate to you; but above the walking
there existed nothing else that could, in respect to it,
operate as a genus; and if nevertheless there existed
things beneath walking, walking would, in respect to
them, be a genus of the essences.</p>

<h3>THE PARTS OF A MANIFOLD UNITY ARE APART
ONLY FOR EXAMINATION.</h3>

<p>Perhaps, instead of saying that the one is the cause
of the other things, we would have to admit that these
things are as parts and elements of the one; and that
all things form a single nature in which only our
thought establishes divisions; so that, by virtue of its
admirable power, this nature be unity distributed in all
things, appearing and becoming manifold, as if it were
in movement, and that the one should cease being
unity as a result of the fruitfulness of its nature. If
we were to enumerate successively the parts of such a
nature, we would grant to each of them a separate
existence, ignoring that we had not seen the whole
together. But after thus having separated the parts,
we would soon reapproximate them, not for long being
able to keep apart the isolated elements which tend
to reunite. That is why we could not help making a
whole out of them, letting them once more become
unity, or rather, be unity. Besides, this will be easier
to understand when we shall know what these essences
are, and how many are the genera of essences; for we
shall then be able to conceive their mode of existence.
And as, in these matters, it is not well to limit oneself
to negations, but to aim at positive knowledge, and at
the full intelligence of the subject here treated, we
shall have to make this inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_898" id="Page_898">898</a></span></p>

<h3>THE GENERA OF ESSENCE WILL BE DETERMINED
BY AN EXAMINATION OF THE PROBLEM OF THE
ONE AND MANY.</h3>

<p>4. If, on occupying ourselves with this sense-world,
we wished to determine the nature of bodies, would we
not begin by studying some part thereof, such as a
stone? We could then distinguish therein substance,
quantity&mdash;such as dimension&mdash;and quality, such as
color; and after having discovered these same elements
in other bodies, we could say that the elements
of the corporeal nature are being, quantity, and quality;
but that these three coexist; and that, though
thought distinguish them, all three form but one and
the same body. If, besides, we were to recognize that
movement is proper to this same organization, would
we not add it to the three elements already distinguished?
These four elements, however, would
form but a single one, and the body, though one,
would, in its nature, be the reunion of all four. We
shall have to take the same course with our present
subject, intelligible Being, and its genera and principles.
Only, in this comparison, we shall have to
make abstraction of all that is peculiar to bodies, such
as generation, sense-perception, and extension. After
having established this separation, and having thus
distinguished essentially different things, we shall arrive
at the conception of a certain intelligible existence,
which possesses real essence, and unity in a still higher
degree. From this standpoint, one might be surprised
how the (substance which is thus) one can be both
one and many. In respect to bodies, it is generally
recognized that the same thing is both one and many;
the body can indeed be divided infinitely; color and
appearance, for instance, are therein very differing
properties, since they are separated here below. But
in respect to the soul, if she be conceived as one, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_899" id="Page_899">899</a></span>
extent, dimension and absolutely simple, as it
appears at first sight, how could we, after that, believe
that the soul were manifold? We should have here
expected to reach unity, all the more as, after having
divided the animal in body and soul, and after having
demonstrated that the body is multiform, composite
and diverse, one might well, on the contrary, have
expected to find the soul simple; and to have accepted
this conclusion as final, as the end of our researches.
We would thus have taken the soul as a sample of
the intelligible world, just as the body represents the
sense-world. Having thus considered this soul, let us
examine how this unity can be manifold; how, in its
turn, the manifold can be unity; not indeed a composite
formed of separable parts, but a single nature simultaneously
one and manifold. For, as we have already
said, it is only by starting from this point and demonstrating
it, that we will establish solidly the truth about
the genera of essence.</p>

<h3>THE SOUL IS A PLURAL UNITY OF SEMINAL
REASONS.</h3>

<p>5. The first consideration that meets us is that
each body, whether of animals or plants, is multiple,
by virtue of its colors, forms, dimensions, the kinds of
parts, and diversity of their position; and that nevertheless
all things derive from unity, whether from the
absolutely simple Unity, or from the habituation of the
universal Unity, or from some principle having more
unity&mdash;and consequently more essence&mdash;than the
things it produces; because, the further the distance
from unity, the less the essence. The principle which
forms the bodies must therefore be one, without either
being absolutely one, nor identical with the One;
otherwise, it would not produce a plurality that was
distant from unity; consequently, it must be a plural-unity.
Now this principle is the soul; therefore she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_900" id="Page_900">900</a></span>
must be a plural unity. This plurality, however, consists
of the ("seminal) reasons" which proceed from
the soul. The reasons, indeed, are not other than the
soul; for the soul herself is reason, being the principle
of the reasons; the reasons are the actualization of
the soul which acts according to her being; and this
being is potentiality of the <span class="locked">reasons.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></span> The soul is
therefore plurality simultaneously with unity; which
is clearly demonstrated by the action she exerts on
other things.</p>

<h3>THE SOUL IS A DEFINITE ESSENCE AS PARTICULAR
BEING.</h3>

<p>But what is the soul considered apart from all action,
if we examine in her the part which does not work at
formation of the bodies?<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> Will not a plurality of
powers still be found therein? As to world-Essence,
nobody even thinks of depriving the soul of it. But
is her acknowledged essence the same as that predicated
of a stone? Surely not. Besides, even in the
essence of the stone, "being" and "being a stone" are
inseparable concepts, just as "being" and "being a
soul" are, in the soul, but one and the same <span class="locked">thing.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></span>
Must we then regard as different in her essence on one
side, and on the other the remainder (what constitutes
the being); so that it would be the difference (proper
to being) which, by being added to her, constituted the
soul? No: the soul is no doubt a determinate essence;
not as a "white man," but only as a particular
being; in other words, she has what she has by her
very being.</p>

<h3>THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL DERIVES FROM ITS
BEING; ADDING LIFE TO ESSENCE.</h3>

<p>6. However, could we not say that the soul does
not have all that she has through her being, in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_901" id="Page_901">901</a></span>
sense, that in her we must distinguish on one hand
essence, and on the other some kind of essence? If
the soul possess such a kind of essence, and if this
kind of essence come to her from without, the whole
will no longer be the being of the soul so far as she is
soul; only partially will it be the being of the soul, and
not in totality. Besides, what would be the essence of
the soul without the other things which constitute her
being? Will the essence be the same for the soul as
for the stone? Will we not rather have to insist that
this essence of the soul derives from her very being;
that this essence is her source and principle; or rather,
that it is all that the soul is, and consequently is life;
and finally that in the soul life and essence fuse?</p>

<h3>SOUL UNITY DOES NOT RESEMBLE THE UNITY OF
A REASON, INCLUDING PLURALITY.</h3>

<p>Shall we say that this unity resembles that of a
"reason" (of a form)? No. The substance of the
soul is one; but such unity does not exclude duality or
even plurality; for it admits of all the attributes essential
to the soul.</p>

<h3>THE SOUL IS BOTH BEING AND LIFE.</h3>

<p>Should we say that the soul is both being and life,
or that she possesses life? To say that the soul possesses
life would mean that the possessor is not inherently
alive, or that life does not inhere in her
"being." If then we cannot say that one of the
two possesses the other, we shall have to recognize
that both are identical, or that the soul is both
one and manifold, in her unity embracing all that appears
in her; that in herself she is one, but manifold
in respect to other things; that, although she be one by
herself, she makes herself multiple by her movement;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_902" id="Page_902">902</a></span>
that, while forming a whole which is one, she seeks
to consider herself in her multiplicity. So Essence
also does not remain unitary, because its potentiality
extends to all it has become. It is contemplation that
makes it appear manifold, the necessary thought has
multiplied it. If it appear as one only, it is only because
it has not yet thought, and it really is still only
one.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST TWO GENERA ARE BEING AND
MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p>7. What and how much can be seen in the soul?
Since we have found in the soul both being and life,
and as both being and life are what is common in
every soul, and as life resides in intelligence, recognizing
that there is (besides the soul and her being)
intelligence and its life, we shall posit as a genus what
is common in all life; namely, movement; consequently,
being and movement, which constitute primary
life, will be our first two categories. Although (in
reality) they fuse, they are distinguished by thought,
which is incapable of approaching unity exclusively;
and whose exercise compels this distinction. Besides,
it is possible, you can, in other objects, clearly see
essence, as distinct from movement or life, although
their essence be not real, and only shadowy or <span class="locked">figurative.<a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></span>
Just as the image of a man lacks several things,
and, among others, the most important, life; likewise,
the essence of sense-objects is only an adumbration of
the veritable essence, lacking as it does the highest
degree of essence, namely, vitality, which appears in
its archetype. So you see it is quite easy to distinguish,
on one hand, essence from life, and, on the other, life
from essence. Essence is a genus, and contains several
species; now movement must not be subsumed under
essence, nor be posited within essence, but should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_903" id="Page_903">903</a></span>
equated with essence. When we locate movement
within essence, it is not that we consider life is the
subject of movement, but because movement is life's
actualization; only in thought can either exist separately.
These two natures, therefore, form but a single
one; for essence exists not in potentiality, but in actualization;
and if we conceive of these two genera as
separated from each other it will still be seen that
movement is within essence, and essence within movement.
In the unity of essence, the two elements, when
considered separately, imply each other reciprocally;
but thought affirms their duality, and shows that each
of the two series is a double unity.</p>

<h3>ANOTHER GENUS IS STABILITY, WHICH IS ONLY
ANOTHER KIND OF MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p>Since then it is in the sphere of essence that movement
appears, and since movement manifests its perfection
far rather than it divides its being; and since
essence, in order to carry out the nature here assigned
to it, must always persevere in movement, it would
be still more absurd to deny it stability, than to refuse
it movement. The notion and the conception of
stability are still more in harmony with the nature of
essence than are those of movement; for it is in essence
that may be found what is called "remaining in
the same state," "existing in the same manner," and
"being uniform." Let us therefore assert that stability
is a genus different from movement, of which it seems
to be the opposite.</p>

<h3>DISTINCTION BETWEEN STABILITY AND ESSENCE.</h3>

<p>In many ways it can be shown that stability must
be kept apart from essence. In the first place, if
stability were identical with essence, why should it be
so, rather than movement, which is life, the actualization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_904" id="Page_904">904</a></span>
of being, and of essence itself? Since we have
distinguished between movement and essence, and since
we have said that it is both identical therewith, and
still at the same time different from it; and because
essence and movement are different from each other
from one viewpoint, but from another, are identical;
we must also (in thought) distinguish stability from
essence without separating it (in existence); and by
separating it in thought, we shall be making a distinct
genus of it. Indeed, if stability and essence were to
be confused together in a perfect union, if we were to
acknowledge no difference between them, we would
still be obliged to identify stability with movement by
the intermediation of essence; in this way stability and
movement would together form but one and the same
<span class="locked">thing.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></span></p>

<h3>ESSENCE, STABILITY AND MOVEMENT EXIST
BECAUSE THOUGHT BY INTELLIGENCE.</h3>

<p>8. We must posit these three genera (essence,
movement, and stability) because intelligence thinks
each of them separately. By thinking them simultaneously,
Intelligence posits them; and, as soon as
Intelligence thinks them, they are (in existence). The
things whose existence ("essence") implies matter do
not exist in Intelligence; for otherwise they would be
immaterial. On the contrary, immaterial things come
into existence by merely being thought. So then contemplate
pure Intelligence, instead of seeking it with
your bodily eyes, fix on it your interior gaze. Then
will you see the hearth of "Being," where shines an
unsleeping light; you will see therein how essences subsist
as simultaneously divided and united; you will see
in it an abiding life, the thought which applies not to
the future, but to the present; which possesses it
already, and possesses it for ever; which thinks what
is intimate to it, and not what is foreign. Intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_905" id="Page_905">905</a></span>
thinks: and you have actualization and movement. Intelligence
thinks what is in itself: and you have "being"
and essence; for, by merely existing, Intelligence
thinks: Intelligence thinks itself as existing, and the
object to which Intelligence applies its thought exists
also. The actualization of Intelligence on itself is
not "being"; but the object to which it refers, the
Principle from which it derives, is essence. Essence,
indeed, is the object of intuition, but not intuition
itself; the latter exists (has "essence") only because it
starts from, and returns thereto. Now as essence is an
actualization, and not a potentiality, it unites both
terms (existence and intuition, object and subject),
and, without separating them, it makes of intuition
essence, and of essence intuition. Essence is the unshakable
foundation of all things, and support of their
existence; it derives its possessions from no foreign
source, holding them from itself, and within itself. It
is simultaneously the goal of thought, because it is
stability that never needed a beginning, and the principle
from which thought was born, because it is unborn
stability; for movement can neither originate from,
nor tend towards movement. The idea also belongs
to the genus of stability, because it is the goal (or
limit) of intelligence; but the intellectual actualization
by which it is thought constitutes movement. Thus
all these things form but one thing; and movement,
stability, and the things which exist in all essences constitute
genera (or classifications). Moreover, every
essence posterior to these genera is, in its turn, also
definite essence, definite stability, and definite movement.</p>

<h3>THIS TRIUNE PLAY IMPLIES ALSO IDENTITY
AND DIFFERENCE.</h3>

<p>Summing up what we have discovered about the
nature of Essence, we find first three genera. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_906" id="Page_906">906</a></span>
these three, Essence, Movement and Stability were contemplated
respectively by the essence, movement and
stability within ourselves, which we also harmonized
with those intelligibles. Then again we lost the power
of distinguishing them by uniting, confusing, and blending
these three genera. But a little later we divided,
extricated and distinguished them so as again to see
essence, movement and stability; three things, of which
each exists apart. The result of this process then is
that they are regarded as different, discerning them
by their differences, and recognizing difference in essence
by positing three things each of which exists
apart. On the other hand, if they be considered in their
relation with unity and in unity, if they be all reduced to
being something single and identical, one may see the
arising, or rather the existing of identity. To the three
genera already recognized, therefore, we shall have
to add identity or difference, or (in Platonic <span class="locked">language<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></span>),
"sameness and other-ness." These two
classifications added to the three others, will in all
make five genera for all things. Identity and difference
(are genuine genera, indeed, because they) also
communicate their characteristics to inferior (beings),
each of which manifests some such element.</p>

<h3>THESE FIVE GENERA ARE PRIMARY BECAUSE
NOTHING CAN BE AFFIRMED OF THEM.</h3>

<p>These five genera that we thus recognize are
primary, because nothing can be predicated of them
in the category of existence (being). No doubt, because
they are essences, essence might be predicated
of them; but essence would not be predicated of them
because "being" is not a particular essence. Neither
is essence to be predicated of movement or stability,
for these are species of essence. Neither does essence
participate in these four genera as if they were superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_907" id="Page_907">907</a></span>
genera under which essence itself would be subsumed;
for stability, movement, identity and difference do
not protrude beyond the sphere of essence, and are
not anterior thereto.</p>

<h3>WHY NOT ADD OTHERS SUCH AS UNITY, QUANTITY,
QUALITY, OR RELATION?</h3>

<p>9. These and similar (Platonic) arguments demonstrate
that those are genuinely primary genera; but
how are we to prove they are exclusive? Why, for
example, should not unity, quantity, quality, relation,
and further (Aristotelian) categories, be added thereto?</p>

<h3>NEITHER ABSOLUTE NOR RELATIVE UNITY CAN
BE A CATEGORY.</h3>

<p>Unity (may mean two things). The absolute Unity,
to which nothing may be added, neither Soul, nor Intelligence,
nor anything else, cannot be predicated as
attribute of anything, and therefore cannot be a genus.
But if we are referring to the unity which we attribute
to essence, when we say that essence is one, it is no
longer the original Unity. Besides, how could the
absolute One, which within itself admits of no difference,
beget species? If it cannot do this, it cannot be
a genus. How indeed could you divide unity? By
dividing it, you would multiply it; and thus Unity-in-itself
would be manifold, and in aspiring to become a
genus it would annihilate itself. Besides, in order to
divide this unity into species, you would have to add
something to unity, because it does not contain differences
such as exist in being. Intelligence might well
admit differences between essences, but this could not
possibly be the case with unity. The moment you add
a single difference, you posit duality, and consequently
destroy unity; for everywhere the addition of a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_908" id="Page_908">908</a></span>
unity causes any previously posited number to disappear.</p>

<h3>UNITY IS NOT SYNONYMOUS WITH ESSENCE.</h3>

<p>It may be objected that the unity which is in essence,
in movement, and the remainder of the genera, is
common to all of them, and that one might therefore
identify unity with <span class="locked">essence.<a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></span> It must then be answered
that, just as essence was not made a genus of
other things because they were not what was essence,
but that they were called essences in another sense,
here likewise unity could not be a common attribute
of other things, because there must be a primary Unity,
and a unity taken in a secondary sense. If, on the
other hand, it be said that unity should not be made
a genus of all things, but something which exists in
itself like the others, if afterwards unity be identified
with essence, then, as essence has already been listed
as one of the genera, we would be merely uselessly
introducing a superfluous <span class="locked">name.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></span> Distinguishing between
unity and essence is an avowal that each has its
separate nature; the addition of "something" to "one"
makes a "certain one"; addition of nothing, on the
other hand, allows unity to remain absolute, which
cannot be predicated of anything. But why could
this unity not be the First Unity, ignoring the absolute
Unity? For we use "first Unity" as a designation of
the essence which is beneath the "absolute Unity."
Because the Principle anterior to the first Essence (that
is, the first and absolute Unity) is not essence; otherwise,
the essence below Him would no longer be the
first Essence; here, on the contrary, the unity which
is above this unity is the absolute Unity. Besides, this
unity which would be separated from essence only in
thought, would not admit of any differences.</p>

<p>Besides, there are three alternatives. Either this unity
alleged to inhere in essence will be, just like all other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_909" id="Page_909">909</a></span>
essences, a consequence of the existence of essence;
and consequently, would be posterior to it. Or, it will
be contemporaneous with essence and the other (categories);
but a genus cannot be contemporaneous with
the things of which it is the genus. The third possibility
is that it may be anterior to essence; in which
case its relation to Essence will be that of a principle,
and no longer a genus containing it. If then unity be
not a genus in respect to essence, neither can it be a
genus in respect of other things; otherwise, we would
have to say of essence also that it was a genus embracing
everything else.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE CANNOT BECOME A GENUS SO LONG
AS IT REMAINS ONE.</h3>

<p>Considering unity according to its essence, it seems
to fuse and coincide with absolute Essence, for essence,
so far as it trends towards unity, is a single essence;
but in so far as it is posterior to unity, it becomes all
things it can be, and becomes manifold. Now, so far
as essence remains one and does not divide, it could
not constitute a genus.</p>

<h3>ELEMENTS OF ESSENCE CAN BE SAID TO BE ONE
ONLY FIGURATIVELY.</h3>

<p>10. In what sense, therefore, could each of the
elements of essence be called "one"? In that it is
something unitary, without being unity itself; for what
is a "certain one" is already manifold. No species is
"one" except <span class="locked">figuratively<a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></span>; for in itself it is manifold.
It is in the same sense that, in this sense-world, we say
that an army, or a choric ballet, constitute a unity.
Not in such things is absolute unity; and therefore it
may not be said that unity is something common.
Neither does unity reside in essence itself, nor in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_910" id="Page_910">910</a></span>
individual essences; therefore, it is not a genus. When
a genus is predicated of something, it is impossible to
predicate of the same thing contrary properties; but of
each of the elements of universal essence it is possible
to assert both unity and its opposite. Consequently (if
we have called unity a genus), after having predicated
of some essence unity as a genus, we would have affirmed,
of the same essence, that unity was not a genus.
Unity, therefore, could not be considered one of the
primary genera; for essence is no more one than it is
manifold. As to the other genera, none of them is one
without being manifold; much less could unity be predicated
of the secondary genera of which each is quite
manifold. Besides, no genus, considered in its totality,
is unitary; so that if unity were a genus, it would merely
thereby cease being unity; for unity is not a number,
and nevertheless it would become a number in becoming
a genus. Of course, numbers include an alleged
unity, as soon as we try to erect it into a genus, it is
no longer a unity, in a strict sense. Among numbers
unity is not applied to them as would have been a
genus; of such unity it is merely said that it is among
numbers, not that it is a genus; likewise, if unity were
among the essences, it would not be there as genus of
essence, nor of anything else, nor of all things. Again,
just as the simple is the principle of the composite
without being considered a genus in respect to it&mdash;then
it would be simultaneously simple and composite&mdash;so,
if one were considered to be a principle, it could
not be a genus in respect to things subsumed under it;
and therefore will be a genus neither for essence, nor
for other (categories or things).</p>

<h3>VARIOUS ARGUMENTS AGAINST UNITY AS A
CATEGORY.</h3>

<p>If unity were to be considered a genus, it could
be that only in respect to the things of which each is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_911" id="Page_911">911</a></span>
said to be <span class="locked">one;<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></span> as if, for instance, one should, from
"being," deduce the unity contained within it. Unity
would then be the genus of certain things; for just as
essence is a genus, not in respect to all things, but in
respect to those species that possess essence, so unity
would be a genus in respect to the species that possess
unity. This, however, is impossible; for things do not
differ in respect to unity, as they do in respect to
essence.</p>

<p>It might further be objected that if the same divisions
which were applied to essence were applied to unity,
and if essence be a genus because it divides itself, and
manifests itself as the same in a number of things, why
then should unity also not be a genus, since it appears
in as many things as essence, and similarly divides
itself? Mere recurrence of something in several essences
is no proof it is a genus; whether in respect to
the essences in which it occurs, or to others. Merely
being common to several essences by no means constitutes
a genus. No one will claim that a point is a
genus for lines or for anything else, though points
be found in all lines. As said, unity is found in every
number, and nevertheless it is not a genus for any
number, or for anything else. The formation of a
genus demands that what is common to several things
show specific differences, constituting species, and be
predicated of what exists. But what are the specific
differences within unity? What species does it form?
If to this it be answered that it forms the same species
as essence, then it blends with essence, and (unity) is
(as said above), only another name for essence; and
essence, as category, suffices.</p>

<h3>GENUINE RELATIONS BETWEEN UNITY AND
ESSENCE.</h3>

<p>11. The questions here to be solved are, how unity
subsists within essence, how they both divide, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_912" id="Page_912">912</a></span>
general how any genera divide; and whether their two
divisions be identical, or different. To solve these
questions, we shall first have to ask how in general any
thing whatever is said to be one, and is one; then, if it
can be said in the same sense that essence is one, in
what sense this is said. Evidently, unity is not the
same for everything. It cannot even be understood in
the same sense in respect to sense-things, and intelligible
things; not any more than essence is identical
for these two order of (beings), or even for sense-things
compared to each other. The idea of unity is
not the same in reference to a choric ballet, an army,
a vessel or a house; it is even less so in respect of one
of these things, and when it deals with continuous
objects. And nevertheless, by their unity all these
things imitate the same archetype, some from far,
some from near. Intelligence, surely, is assuredly that
which most approaches absolute Unity; for although
the soul already possess unity, Intelligence possesses
it far more intensely; for it is the one essence.</p>

<h3>UNITY REIGNS STILL MORE IN THE GOOD.</h3>

<p>Is the expression of the essence of something simultaneously
the expression of its unity, so that it possesses
as much unity as it possesses essence? Or does
this simultaneousness exist without any direct proportion
between the amount of unity and essence? Yes;
for it is possible that something have less unity without,
on that account, having any the less essence; an army,
a choric ballet have not less essence than a house,
though far less unity. The unity present in each thing
seems therefore to aspire to the Good, which has the
most <span class="locked">unity;<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></span> for the closer something approaches the
Good, the greater unity does it achieve; that is the
criterion of greater or less unity. Indeed, every (being)
desires not only merely to be (alive), but to enjoy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_913" id="Page_913">913</a></span>
Good. That is why everything, so far as it can, hastens
to become one, and those (beings) which by nature
possess unity naturally trend towards Him by desiring
to unite with themselves. For every (being) hastens
not to separate from others, but on the contrary their
tendency is to tend towards each other and themselves.
That is why all souls, while preserving their
individual nature, would like to fuse into a single soul.
The One reigns everywhere in the sense-world, as well
as in the Intelligible. It is from Him that everything
originates, it is towards Him that everything trends.
In Him do all (beings) seek their principle and their
goal; for only therein do they find their good; only by
that does each (being) subsist, and occupies its place in
the universe; once that it exists, no (being) could help
trending towards the One. This occurs not only in
nature, but even in the arts; where each art seeks, to
the extent of its ability, to conform its works to unity,
to the extent of its ability, and to the possibilities of its
works. But that which succeeds best, is Essence itself,
which is quite close to unity.</p>

<h3>FURTHER REASONS WHY UNITY IS NOT A
CATEGORY.</h3>

<p>Consequently, in speaking of (beings) other than
(essence itself), as, for instance, of man, we say simply
"man" (without adding to it the idea of <span class="locked">unity<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></span>); if
however we say "a man," it is to distinguish him from
two; if however we use the word one in still another
sense, it is by adding to it "some" (as, "someone").
Not so is it with essence; we say, "being one," conceiving
of "being" ("essence") and one, as if forming
a single whole, and in positing essence as one, we
emphasize its narrow affinity with the Good. Thus
conceived, essence becomes <span class="locked">one;<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></span> and in the one
finds its origin and goal. Nevertheless it is not one as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_914" id="Page_914">914</a></span>
unity itself, but rather in a different manner, in this
sense that the (unity of essence) admits priority and
posteriority. What then is (the unity of essence)?
Must it not then be considered similar in all the parts
(of essence), as something common to all (and consequently,
as forming a genus)? But in the first place,
the point is also something common to all the lines, and
nevertheless it is not a genus; in the numbers, unity is
something common to all, and is not any more of a
genus. Indeed, the unity which is found in the monad,
in the dyad (or pair), and in other numbers, cannot
be confused with unity in itself. Then, nothing hinders
there being in essence some anterior, and other posterior
parts, both simple and compound ones (which
would be impossible for the One in itself). Even if
the unity found everywhere in all the parts of essence
were everywhere identical, by the mere fact that it
would offer no difference, it could not give rise to
species, and consequently, it could not be a genus.</p>

<h3>BY TENDING TOWARDS THE ONE, EVERYTHING
TENDS TOWARDS THE GOOD.</h3>

<p>12. We therefore assert (that by moving towards
unity everything moves towards the Good). How can
it be, however, that Goodness should consist in coming
closer to unity, even for number, which is inanimate?<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a>
This question might as well be asked about any inanimate
object whatever. If we were told that such
(beings) do not enjoy (existence), we might answer
that we are here treating of beings according to their
proximity to unity only. If, for instance, we were
asked how a point can participate in the Good, we
might answer by a retort, asking whether we are dealing
with the Point in itself. Then we would answer
by the observation that the state of affairs was the
same for all things of the same kind. If however we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_915" id="Page_915">915</a></span>
were pressed about the point considered as existing in
some object, as, for instance, in the circle, we would
answer that for such a point, the Good is the good of
the circle (of which it forms part); that such is the
Good towards which it aspires, and that it seeks that
as far as possible through the intermediation of the
circle.</p>

<h3>THESE GENERA EXIST IN BOTH THE SUBORDINATE
OBJECTS, AND THEMSELVES.</h3>

<p>But how could we realize such genera? Are all
these genera susceptible of division, or do they lie
entire within each of the objects they comprehend?
If so, how does this unity find itself? Unity exists
therein as a genus, just as the whole exists within the
plurality.</p>

<p>Does unity exist only in the objects that participate
therein? Not only in these objects, but also in itself.
This point will be studied later.</p>

<h3>QUANTITY IS A SECONDARY GENUS, THEREFORE
NOT A FIRST.</h3>

<p>13. Now why should we not posit quantity among
the primary genera? And why not also quality?
Quantity is not one of the primary genera like those
we have posited, because the primary genera coexist
with essence (which is not the case with quantity).
Indeed, movement is inseparable from essence; being
its actualization and life. Stability is implied in being;
while identity and difference are still more inseparable
from essence; so that all these (categories) appear to
us simultaneously. As to number (which is discrete
quantity), it is something posterior. As to (mathematical)
numbers, far more are they posterior both to
these genera, and themselves; for the numbers follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_916" id="Page_916">916</a></span>
each other; the second depends on the first, and so
forth; the last are contained within the first. Number,
therefore, cannot be posited among the primary genera.
Indeed, it is permissible to doubt whether quantity may
be posited as any kind of a genus. More even than
number, extension (which is continuous quantity),
shows the characteristics of compositeness, and of
posteriority. Along with number, the line enters into
the idea of extension. This would make two elements.
Then comes surface, which makes three. If then it
be from number that continuous dimension derives its
quantitativeness, how could this dimension be a genus,
when number is not? On the other hand, anteriority
and posteriority exist in dimension as well as in numbers.
But if both kinds of quantities have in common
this, that they are quantities, it will be necessary to
discover the nature of quantity. When this will have
been found, we shall be able to make of it a secondary
genus; but it could not rank with the primary genera.
If, then, quantity be a genus without being a primary
one, it will still remain for us to discover to which
higher genus, whether primary or secondary, it should
be subsumed.</p>

<h3>NUMBER AND DIMENSION DIFFER SO MUCH AS TO
SUGGEST DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION.</h3>

<p>It is evident that quantity informs us of the amount
of a thing, and permits us to measure this; therefore
itself must be an amount. This then is the element
common to number (the discrete quantity), and to
continuous dimension. But number is anterior, and
continuous dimension proceeds therefrom; number
consists in a certain blending of movement and
stability; continuous dimension is a certain movement
or proceeds from some movement; movement produces
it in its progress towards infinity, but stability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_917" id="Page_917">917</a></span>
arrests it in its progress, limits it, and creates unity.
Besides, we shall in the following explain the generation
of number and dimension; and, what is more,
their mode of existence, and how to conceive of it
rightly. It is possible that we might find that number
should be posited among the primary genera, but that,
because of its composite nature, continuous dimension
should be posited among the posterior or later genera;
that number is to be posited among stable things, while
dimension belongs among those in movement. But,
as said above, all this will be treated of later.</p>

<h3>QUALITY IS NOT A PRIMARY GENUS BECAUSE IT
IS POSTERIOR TO BEING.</h3>

<p>14. Let us now pass on to quality. Why does
quality also fail to appear among the primary genera?
Because quality also is posterior to them; it does indeed
follow after being. The first Being must have
these (quantity and quality) as consequences, though
being is neither constituted nor completed thereby;
otherwise, being would be posterior to them. Of
course, as to the composite beings, formed of several
elements, in which are both numbers and qualities,
they indeed are differentiated by those different elements
which then constitute qualities, though they
simultaneously contain common (elements). As to
the primary genera, however, the distinction to be
established does not proceed from simpleness or compositeness,
but of simpleness and what completes being.
Notice, I am not saying, "of what completes 'some one'
being"; for if we were dealing with some one being,
there would be nothing unreasonable in asserting that
such a being was completed by a quality, since this
being would have been in existence already before
having the quality, and would receive from the exterior
only the property of being such or such. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_918" id="Page_918">918</a></span>
the contrary, absolute Being must essentially possess
all that constitutes it.</p>

<h3>COMPLEMENT OF BEING IS CALLED QUALITY ONLY
BY COURTESY.</h3>

<p>Besides, we have elsewhere pointed <span class="locked">out<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></span> that what
is a complement of being is called a quality figuratively
<span class="locked">only;<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></span> and that what is genuinely quality comes from
the exterior, posteriorly to being. What properly
belongs to being is its actualization; and what follows
it is an experience (or, negative modification). We
now add that what refers to some being, cannot in any
respect be the complement of being. There is no need
of any addition of "being" (existence) to man, so
far as he is a man, to make of him a (human) being.
Being exists already in a superior region before descending
to specific difference; thus the animal exists
(as being) before one descends to the property of
being reasonable, when one says: "Man is a reasonable
<span class="locked">animal."<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></span></p>

<h3>THE FOUR OTHER CATEGORIES DO NOT TOGETHER
FORM QUALITY.</h3>

<p>15. However, how do four of these genera complete
being, without nevertheless constituting the suchness
(or, quality) of being? for they do not form a
"certain being." The primary Essence has already been
mentioned; and it has been shown that neither movement,
difference, nor identity are anything else. Movement,
evidently, does not introduce any quality in
essence; nevertheless it will be wise to study the question
a little more definitely. If movement be the
actualization of being, if essence, and in general all
that is in the front rank be essentially an actualization,
movement cannot be considered as an accident. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_919" id="Page_919">919</a></span>
it is, however, the actualization of the essence which
is in actualization, it can no longer be called a simple
complement of "being," for it is "being" itself. Neither
must it be ranked amidst things posterior to "being,"
nor amidst the qualities; it is contemporaneous with
"being," for you must not suppose that essence existed
first, and then moved itself (these being contemporaneous
events). It is likewise with stability; for
one cannot say that essence existed first, and then later
became stable. Neither are identity or difference
any more posterior to essence; essence was not first
unitary, and then later manifold; but by its essence it
is one manifold. So far as it is manifold, it implies
difference; while so far as it is a manifold unity, it
implies identity. These categories, therefore, suffice
to constitute "being." When one descends from the
intelligible world to inferior things, he meets other
elements which indeed no longer constitute absolute
"being," but only a "certain being," that possesses
some particular quantity or quality; these are indeed
genera, but genera inferior to the primary genera.</p>

<h3>RELATION IS AN APPENDAGE EXISTING ONLY
AMONG DEFINITE OBJECTS.</h3>

<p>16. As to relation, which, so to speak, is only an
offshoot or <span class="locked">appendage,<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></span> it could certainly not be
posited amidst the primary genera. Relation can exist
only between one thing and another; it is nothing
which exists by itself; every relation presupposes something
foreign.</p>

<h3>NEITHER CAN PLACE OR TIME FIGURE AMONG
<span class="locked">THEM.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></span></h3>

<p>The categories of place and time are just as unable
to figure among the primary genera. To be in a
place, is to be in something foreign; which implies two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_920" id="Page_920">920</a></span>
<span class="locked">consequences:<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></span> a genus must be single, and admits of
no compositeness. Place, therefore, is no primary
genus. For here we are dealing only with veritable
essences.</p>

<p>As to time, does it possess a veritable characteristic?
Evidently not. If time be a measure, and not a measure
pure and simple, but the measure of <span class="locked">movement,<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></span> it
also is something double, and consequently composite.
(This, as with place, would debar it from being ranked
among the primary genera, which are simple). Besides,
it is something posterior to movement; so that
it could not even be ranked along with movement.</p>

<h3>ACTION, EXPERIENCE, POSSESSION AND LOCATION
ARE SIMILARLY UNSATISFACTORY.</h3>

<p>Action and experience equally depend on movement.
Now, as each of them is something double,
each of them, consequently, is something composite.
Possession also is double. Location, which consists in
something's being in some definite way in something
else, actually comprises three elements. (Therefore
possession and location, because composite, are not
simple primary genera).</p>

<h3>NEITHER ARE GOOD, BEAUTY, VIRTUE, SCIENCE,
OR INTELLIGENCE.</h3>

<p>17. But why should not the Good, beauty, virtues,
science, or intelligence be considered primary genera?
If by "good" we understand the First, whom we call
the Good itself, of whom indeed we could not affirm
anything, but whom we call by this name, because we
have none better to express our meaning, He is not a
genus; for He cannot be affirmed of anything else.
If indeed there were things of which He could be
predicated, each of them would be the Good Himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_921" id="Page_921">921</a></span>
Besides, the Good does not consist in "being," and
therefore is above it. But if by "good" we mean only
the quality (of goodness), then it is evident that
quality cannot be ranked with primary genera. Does
this imply that Essence is not good? No; it is good,
but not in the same manner as the First, who is good,
not by a quality, but by Himself.</p>

<p>It may however be objected that, as we saw
above, essence contains other genera, and that each
of these is a genus because it has something in common,
and because it is found in several things. If then
the Good be found in each part of "being" or essence,
or at least, in the greater number of them, why would
not also the Good be a genus, and one of the first
genera? Because the Good is not the same in all
parts of Essence, existing within it in the primary
or secondary degree; and because all these different
goods are all subordinate to each other, the last depending
on the first, and all depending from a single
Unity, which is the supreme Good; for if all participate
in the Good, it is only in a manner that varies according
to the nature of each.</p>

<h3>IF THE GOOD BE A GENUS, IT MUST BE ONE OF
THE POSTERIOR ONES.</h3>

<p>If you insist that the Good must be genus, we will
grant it, as a posterior genus; for it will be posterior to
being. Now the existence of (the Aristotelian) <span class="locked">"essence,"<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a></span>
although it be always united to Essence, is
the Good itself; while the primary genera belong to
Essence for its own sake, and form "being." Hence
we start to rise up to the absolute Good, which is
superior to Essence; for it is impossible for essence
and "being" not to be manifold; essence necessarily
includes the above-enumerated primary genera; it is
the manifold unity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_922" id="Page_922">922</a></span></p>

<h3>IF THE EXCLUSIVE GOOD MEAN UNITY, A NEW
GENUS WOULD BE UNNECESSARY.</h3>

<p>But if by Good we here mean the unity which lies in
Essence, we would not hesitate to acknowledge that
the actualization by which Essence aspires to Unity
is its true good, and that that is the means by which
it receives the form of Good. Then the good of
Essence is the actualization by which it aspires to the
Good; that act constitutes its life; now this actualization
is a movement, and we have already ranked
movement among the primary genera. (It is therefore
useless to make a new genus of "Good conceived
as unity").</p>

<h3>BEAUTY IS TREATED SIMILARLY TO THE GOOD.</h3>

<p>18. As to the beautiful, if that be taken to mean
the primary and supreme Beauty, we would answer
as about the Good, or at least, we would make an
analogous answer. If however we mean only the
splendor with which the Idea shines, it may be answered
that that splendor is not the same everywhere; and
that, besides, it is something <span class="locked">posterior.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></span> If the
beautiful be considered as absolute Being, it is then
already comprised with the "Being" already considered
(and consequently does not form a separate
<span class="locked">genus<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></span>). If it be considered in respect to us human
beings, who are spectators, and if it be explained as
producing in us a certain emotion, such an actualization
is a movement; but if, on the contrary, it be
explained as that tendency which draws us to the
beautiful, this still is a movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_923" id="Page_923">923</a></span></p>

<h3>KNOWLEDGE IS EITHER A MOVEMENT OR
SOMETHING COMPOSITE.</h3>

<p>Knowledge is pre-eminently movement; for it is the
intuition of essence; it is an actualization, and not a
simple habit. It should, therefore, also be reduced
to <span class="locked">movement.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></span> It may also be reduced to stability
(if considered as a durable actualization); or rather,
it belongs to both genera. But if it belong to two
different genera, it is something of a blend; but anything
blended is necessarily posterior (to the elements
which enter into the blend, and it cannot therefore
either be a primary genus).</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE, JUSTICE, VIRTUES AND TEMPERANCE
ARE NO GENERA.</h3>

<p>Intelligence is thinking essence, a composite of all
genera, and not a single genus. Veritable Intelligence
is indeed essence connected with all things; consequently
it is all essence. As to essence considered
alone, it constitutes a genus, and is an element of Intelligence.
Last, justice, temperance, and in general
all the virtues are so many actualizations of Intelligence.
They could not, therefore, rank amidst the
primary genera. They are posterior to a genus, and
constitute species.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE DERIVES ITS DIFFERENCES FROM THE
OTHER CO-ORDINATE CATEGORIES.</h3>

<p>19. Since these four categories (which complete
essence, namely, movement, stability, identity and difference)
(with Essence as a fifth) constitute the
primary genera, it remains to be examined whether
each of them, by itself, can beget species; for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_924" id="Page_924">924</a></span>
whether Essence, entirely by itself, could admit
divisions in which the other categories would have no
share whatever. No: for, in order to beget species,
the genus would have to admit differences derived
from outside; these differences would have to be
properties belonging to Essence as such, without however
being Essence. But from where then would
Essence have derived them? Impossibly from what
does not exist. If then they were necessarily derived
from that which exists, as only three other genera of
essences <span class="locked">remain,<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></span> evidently, Essence must have derived
its differences from these genera, which associate
themselves with Essence, while yet enjoying a
simultaneous existence. But from this very fact that
these genera enjoy an existence simultaneous (with
Essence), they serve to constitute it, as it is composed
of the gathering of these elements. How then could
they be different from the whole that they constitute?
How do these genera make species out of all (these
beings)? How, for instance, could pure movement
produce species of movement? The same question
arises in connection with the other genera. Besides,
we must avoid (two dangers:) losing each genus in its
species, and, on the other hand, reducing it to the
state of a simple predicate, by considering it only in its
species. The genus must exist both in its species and
in itself. While blending (with the species), it must
in itself remain pure and unblended; for, if it should
contribute to "being" otherwise (by blending with its
species), it would annihilate itself. Such are the questions
that must be examined.</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE AS A COMPOSITE IS POSTERIOR
TO THE CATEGORIES.</h3>

<p>Now, we have above posited certain premises. Intelligence,
and even every intelligence, includes within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_925" id="Page_925">925</a></span>
itself all (essences). We ranked (Essence or Being)
above all species that are parts thereof. Essence is
not yet Intelligence. From these it results that already
developed Intelligence is already something posterior.
We shall therefore make use of this study to achieve
the goal we had set ourselves (namely, to determine
the relation of the genus to its contained species). We
shall therefore make use of Intelligence as an example
to extend our knowledge of this subject.</p>

<h3>KNOWLEDGE IS THE ACTUALIZATION OF THE
NOTIONS WHICH ARE POTENTIAL SCIENCE.</h3>

<p>20. Let us, therefore, suppose that Intelligence
was in a state in which it did not yet attach itself to
anything in particular, so that it had not yet become
an individual intelligence. Let us conceive it similar
to knowledge considered by itself before the notions
of the particular species, or to the knowledge of a
species taken before the notions of the contained parts.
Universal Knowledge, without (in actualization) being
any particular notion, potentially lies within all notions,
and reciprocally, each particular notion is one single
thing in actualization, but all things in potentiality;
likewise with universal Knowledge. The notions which
thus refer to a species exist potentially in universal
Knowledge, because, while applying itself to a species,
they potentially are also universal Knowledge. Universal
Knowledge is predicated of each particular
notion, without the particular notion being predicated
of universal Knowledge; but universal Knowledge
must none the less subsist in itself without blending
(with anything <span class="locked">else<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></span>).</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE IS THE POTENTIALITY OF THE INTELLIGENCES
WHICH ARE ITS ACTUALIZATIONS.</h3>

<p>The case is similar with Intelligence. There is a kind
of existence of universal Intelligence, which is located<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_926" id="Page_926">926</a></span>
above the particular actualized intelligences, and is
different from that of the particular intelligences.
These are filled with universal notions: universal Intelligence
furnishes to the particular intelligences the
notions they possess. It is the potentiality of these
intelligences all of which it contains in its universality;
on their side, these, in their particularity, contain
universal Intelligence just as a particular science implies
universal science. The great Intelligence exists
in itself, and the particular intelligences also exist in
themselves; they are implied in universal Intelligence,
just as this one is implied in the particular intelligences.
Each one of the particular intelligences exists simultaneously
in itself, and in something else (in the universal
Intelligence), just as universal Intelligence
exists simultaneously in itself and in all the others. In
universal Intelligence, which exists in itself, all particular
intelligences exist potentially, because it actually
is all the intelligences, and potentially each of them
separately. On the contrary, these are actualizations
of the particular intelligences, and potentially universal
Intelligence. Indeed, so far as they are what is predicated
of them, they are actualizations of what is predicated;
so far as they exist in the genus that contains
them, they are this genus <span class="locked">potentially.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a></span> Genus, as
such, is potentially all the species it embraces; it is
none of them in actuality; but all are implied therein.
So far as genus is in actualization what exists before
the species, it is the actualization of the things which
are not particular. As occurs in the species, these particular
things achieve such actualization only by the
actualization which emanates from the genus, and
which, with regard to them, acts as cause.</p>

<h3>HOW INTELLIGENCE, THOUGH ONE, PRODUCES
PARTICULAR THINGS.</h3>

<p>21. How then does Intelligence, though remaining
one, by Reason produce particular things? This really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_927" id="Page_927">927</a></span>
amounts to asking how the inferior genera derive from
the four Genera. We shall then have to scrutinize
how this great and ineffable Intelligence, which does
not make use of speech, but which is entire intelligence,
intelligence of all, universal, and not particular or individual
intelligence, contains all the things which proceed
therefrom.</p>

<p>(Of the essences it contains) it possesses the number,
as it is both one and many. It is many, that is,
(it is) many potentialities, which are admirable powers,
full of force and greatness, because they are pure;
powers that are vigorous and veritable because they
have no goal at which they are forced to stop; consequently
being infinite, that is, supreme Infinity, and
Greatness. If then we were to scrutinize this greatness
and beauty of being, if by the splendor and light which
surround it, we were to distinguish what Intelligence
contains, then would we see the efflorescing of quality.
With the continuity of actualization we would behold
greatness, in quiescent condition. As we have seen
one (number), two (quality), and three (greatness),
greatness, as the third thing, presents itself with universal
quantity. Now, as soon as quality and quantity
show themselves to us, they unite, blend into one and
the same figure (outward appearance). Then comes
difference, which divides quality and quantity, whence
arise different qualities, and differences of figure. The
presence of identity produces equality, and that of
difference, inequality, both in quantity, number, and
dimension; hence the circle, the quadrilateral, and the
figures composed of unequal things; hence numbers
that are similar, and different, even and uneven.</p>

<h3>THIS INTELLECTUAL LIFE POSSESSES THE
REASONS OR IDEAS.</h3>

<p>Thus intellectual Life, which is the perfect actualization,
embraces all the things that our mind now conceives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_928" id="Page_928">928</a></span>
and all intellectual operations. In its potentiality
it contains all things as essences, in the same
manner as Intelligence does. Now Intelligence possesses
them by thought, a thought which is not discursive
(but intuitive). The intellectual life therefore
possesses all the things of which there are "reasons"
(that is, ideas); itself is a single Reason, great, perfect,
which contains all <span class="locked">reasons,<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></span> which examines
them in an orderly fashion, beginning with the first,
or rather, which has ever examined them, so that one
could never really tell that it was examining <span class="locked">them.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></span>
For all things that we grasp by ratiocination, in whatever
part soever of the universe they may be located,
are found as intuitively possessed by Intelligence. It
would seem as if it was Essence itself which, (being
identical with Intelligence), had made Intelligence reason
thus (by producing its conceptions),<a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> as appears
to happen in the ("seminal) reasons" which produce
the <span class="locked">animals.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></span> In the (ideas, that is in the "seminal)
reasons" which are anterior to ratiocination, all things
are found to possess a constitution such that the most
penetrating intelligence would have considered best,
by <span class="locked">reasoning.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></span> We should therefore expect (great
and wonderful things) of these Ideas, superior and
anterior to Nature and ("seminal) reasons." There
Intelligence fuses with <span class="locked">"Being;"<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a></span> neither in essence
nor intelligence is there anything adventitious. There
everything is smoothly perfect, since everything there
is conformable to intelligence. All Essence is what
Intelligence demands; it is consequently veritable
primary Essence; for if it proceeded from some other
(source), this also would be Intelligence.</p>

<h3>FROM ESSENCE ARE BORN ALL LIVING ORGANISMS.</h3>

<p>Thus Essence reveals within itself all the Forms and
universality. This could not have been particular;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_929" id="Page_929">929</a></span>
for it could not be single, the double presence of difference
and identity demanding it to be simultaneously
one and many. Since, from its very origin, Essence is
one and many, all the species it contains must consequently
simultaneously contain unity and plurality,
revealing dimensions, qualities, and different figures;
for it is impossible that Essence should lack anything,
or should not be complete universality; for it would
no longer be universal, if it were not complete. Life,
therefore, penetrates every thing; is everywhere
present within it. Hence results that from that Life
must have been born all living organisms, for since
matter and quality are found within their bodies, these
also are not lacking. Now, as all living organisms are
born within it, and have ever subsisted within it, they
were essentially embraced within eternity, yet, taken
separately, each of them is a different essence. Taken
together they form a unity. Consequently, the complex
and synthetic totality of all these living organisms
is Intelligence, which, thus containing all (beings),
is the perfect and essential living Organism. When
Intelligence allows itself to be contemplated by what
derives existence from it, Intelligence appears thereto
as the intelligible, and receives this predicate properly
and <span class="locked">truly.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></span></p>

<h3>THUS INTELLIGENCE BEGETS WORLD SOUL AND
INDIVIDUAL SOULS.</h3>

<p>22. This was what Plato meant, when he said,
enigmatically, "Intelligence contemplates the Ideas
contained within the perfect living Organism; it sees
what they are, and to how many they <span class="locked">amount."<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></span>
Indeed, the (universal) Soul, which ranks immediately
after Intelligence, possesses the Ideas in herself inasmuch
as she is a soul; but she sees them better in the
Intelligence which is above <span class="locked">her.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></span> Likewise, our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_930" id="Page_930">930</a></span>
intelligence, which also contains the ideas, sees them
better when it contemplates them in the superior Intelligence;
for, in itself, it can only see; but in the
superior Intelligence it sees that it <span class="locked">sees.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></span> Now this
intelligence that contemplates the ideas is not separated
from the superior Intelligence, for it proceeds therefrom;
but as it is the plurality that has proceeded from
the unity, because it adds difference (to identity), it
becomes manifold unity. Being thus both unity and
plurality, Intelligence, by virtue of its multiple nature,
produces the plurality (of beings). Besides, it would
be impossible to discover therein anything that was
numerically unitary, or anything that might be called
individual. Whatever be contemplated in it, it is always
a form, for it contains no matter. That is why, again,
Plato, referring to this truth, said that "being" was
divided to <span class="locked">infinity.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a></span> Descending from genus to
species, we have not yet arrived at infinity; for that
which thus arises is defined by the species that have
been begotten by a genus; the name of infinity applies
better to the last species, which can no longer be
divided into species. That is why (as Plato teaches),
"when one has arrived at individuals, they must be
abandoned to <span class="locked">infinity."<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></span> Thus, the individuals are
infinite so far as they are considered in themselves;
but, in so far as they are embraced by unity, they are
reduced to a number.</p>

<p>Intelligence therefore embraces what comes after it,
the Soul; so that the Soul, till the last of her powers,
is contained by a number; as to the last power (matter),
it is entirely <span class="locked">infinite<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></span> Considered in this condition
(where, turning towards what is below it, it
begets the Soul), Intelligence is a part (because it applies
itself to something particular), though it possess
all things, and though, in itself, it be universal; the
intelligences which compose it are each a part (each
constituting a particular intelligence by virtue of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_931" id="Page_931">931</a></span>
actualization of Intelligence which exists (and thus
exists in itself). As to the Soul, she is the part of a
part (that is, a part of the Intelligence which itself is
a part, as has just been said), but exists by virtue of
the actualization of the Intelligence which acts outside
of itself. Indeed, when Intelligence acts in itself, the
actualizations it produces are the other intelligences;
when it acts outside of itself, it produces the Soul.
When in her turn, the Soul acts as genus or species,
she begets the other souls which are her species. These
souls themselves have two actualizations; the one,
directed towards what is above them, constitutes their
intelligence; the other, directed towards what is below
them, gives birth to the other rational powers, and
even to a last power which is in contact with matter,
and which fashions <span class="locked">it.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></span> The inferior part of the
soul does not hinder the whole remainder from remaining
in the superior <span class="locked">region.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></span> Besides, this inferior part
is only the very image of the soul; it is not separated
from <span class="locked">her,<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></span> but it resembles the image reflected by a
mirror, an image which persists only so long as the
model remains before the mirror. What should be
our conception of the model placed before the mirror?
Down through what is immediately above the image
(that is, down through the soul herself), we have the
intelligible world, composed of all the intelligible entities,
where everything is perfect. The sense-world is
no more than the imitation thereof, and it imitates
that intelligible world so far as it can, in that it itself
is a living organism which is the image of the perfect
living Organism. The sense-world imitates it as the
portrait that is painted, or reflected by the surface of
water reproduces the person situated before the painter,
or above the water. This portrait obtained by the
painting, or reflected by the surface of the water is not
the image of the composite which constitutes the man
(the soul and body), but of one or two parts only, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_932" id="Page_932">932</a></span>
body which was fashioned by the soul. Likewise,
therefore, the sense-world, which was made to resemble
the intelligible world, offers us images, not
of its creator, but of the (essences) contained within
its creator, among which is man, along with all other
animals. Now, in common with its creator, each
living organism possesses life, though each possess it
differently; both, besides, equally form part of the
intelligible world.</p>

<h3>GENERA OF THE PHYSICAL ARE DIFFERENT FROM
THOSE OF THE INTELLIGIBLE.</h3>

<p>1. We have thus declared our views about (intelligible)
Being, and shown how they agree with the
doctrines of Plato. Now we have to study the "other
nature" (the Being of the sense-world); and we shall
have to consider whether it be proper to establish here
the same genera as for the intelligible world, or to
posit a greater number, by adding some to those
already recognized; or whether the genera differ in
each being entirely, or only partially, some remaining
identical, while others differ. If any of them be identical
in both beings, that can be understood only by
<span class="locked">analogy;<a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></span> that is what will become evident when each
of these beings are fully understood.</p>

<h3>THE WORLD MUST BE STUDIED, JUST AS ONE
WOULD ANALYZE THE VOICE.</h3>

<p>This is by what we must begin. Having to speak
of sense-objects, and knowing that all of them are
contained in this world here below, we must first
scrutinize this world, establish within it divisions according
to the nature of the (beings) which compose
it, and then distribute them into genera, just as we
would do if we had to analyze the voice whose nature
is infinite (by the diversity of sounds it produces),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_934" id="Page_934">934</a></span>
reducing it to a definite number of <span class="locked">kinds.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></span> Observing
the elements common to many sounds, we would reduce
them to one unity, then, to a superior unity,
further to a supreme unity, in which these sounds
appear as a small number of classes. Then, the elements
common to these individuals would be called
"species," and that common to various species would
be called a genus. As to the voice, it is easy enough
to discover each species, to reduce all the species to
unity, and to predicate of all of them (as highest genus
or category) the general element, the voice. But an
analysis as summary as this is impossible with the
(more complicated universe). In the sense-world we
will have to recognize several genera, which will differ
from those of the intelligible world, since the sense-world
itself differs from the intelligible world so much
that it is not its counterpart, but only its image, whose
only element common (to its model) is the name.</p>

<h3>WE MUST FIRST DISSECT AWAY THE SOUL FROM
THE BODY, TO EXAMINE IT.</h3>

<p>As here below in the "mixture" (or blend, the soul),
and the composition (the body) (which form our
nature) there are two parts, soul and body, the totality
of which forms the living <span class="locked">organism;<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></span> as the nature of
the soul belongs to the intelligible world, and consequently
does not belong to the same order of things
as the sense-world, we shall, however difficult it may
be, have to separate the <span class="locked">soul<a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></span> from the sense-objects
which we are here alone to consider. (We shall
illustrate this by a parable). He who would wish to
classify the inhabitants of a town according to their
dignities and professions, would have to leave aside
the foreign residents. As to the passions which arise
from the union of the soul with the body, or, that the
soul experiences because of the <span class="locked">body,<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a></span> we shall later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_935" id="Page_935">935</a></span>
examine how they should be <span class="locked">classified.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></span> This however
must follow our study of the sense-objects.</p>

<h3>WHAT IS BEING IN THE INTELLIGIBLE IS GENERATION
IN THE SENSE-WORLD.</h3>

<p>2. First let us consider what mundane name
"Being" must be applied to. To begin with, it must
be explained that physical nature can receive the name
of "being" only as a figure of <span class="locked">speech;<a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></span> or rather,
should not receive it at all, since it implies the idea
of perpetual flowing (that is, <span class="locked">change<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></span>); so, the more
suitable denomination would be <span class="locked">"generation."<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a></span> We
shall also have to acknowledge that the things that
belong to generation are very different; nevertheless
all bodies, some simple (such, as elements), the others
composite as mixtures), together with their accidents
and effects, must, during the process of classification,
be reduced to a single genus.</p>

<p>In bodies, one may besides distinguish on one hand
matter, on the other, the form imprinted thereon; and
we designate each of these separately as a genus,
or subsume both under a unity, inasmuch as we designate
both by the common <span class="locked">label<a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></span> of "being," or rather,
"generation." But what is the common element in
matter and form? In what manner, and of what is
matter a genus? For what difference inheres in matter?
In what sequence could we incorporate that which
is composed of both? But in the case that that which
is composed of both be itself corporeal being, while
neither of the two is a body, how then could either be
incorporated in a single genus, or within the same
genus along with the compound of both? How (could
this incorporation into a single genus be effected with)
the elements of some object and the object itself? To
answer that we should begin by the (composite)
bodies: which would be tantamount to learning to read
by beginning with syllables (and not with letters).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_936" id="Page_936">936</a></span></p>

<h3>CAN WE ANALYZE THIS WORLD BY ANALOGY WITH
THE INTELLIGIBLE?</h3>

<p>Let us now grant that symmetrical analysis by individual
objects is impossible. Might we not, as a
means of classification, then employ analogy? In
this case the (intelligible, higher) "being" would here
be represented by matter; and movement above, by
form here, which would thus quicken and perfect
matter. The inertia of matter would correspond to
rest above, while the (intelligible) identity and difference
would correspond to our earthly manifold resemblance
and <span class="locked">differences.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></span> (Such an analogic method
would misrepresent the state of affairs in this world).
To begin with, matter does not receive form as its
life or actualization, but (form) approaches and informs
(matter) as something foreign (form deriving
from being, while matter is only a deception; so that
there is no kinship between them). Then in the (intelligible
world) form is an actualization and motion,
while here below movement is different, being accidental;
we might far rather call form the halting or
rest of matter, for form defines that which in itself
is indefinite (unlimited). There (in the intelligible
world) identity and difference refer to a single essence,
which is both identical and different. Here below,
essence differs only relatively, by participation (in the
difference) for it is something identical and different,
not by consequence, as above, but here below, by
nature. As to stability, how could it be attributed to
matter, which assumes all dimensions, which receives
all its forms from without, without itself ever being
able to beget anything by means of these forms?
Such a division, therefore, will have to be given up.</p>

<h3>PHYSICAL CATEGORIES ARE MATTER, FORM, COMBINATION,
ATTRIBUTES AND ACCIDENTS.</h3>

<p>3. What classification shall we adopt? There is
first matter, then form, and further the combination
which results from their blending. Then we have a
number of conceptions which refer to the three preceding
classes, and are predicated of them; the first,
simply, as attributes; the others, besides, as accidents.
Among the latter, some are contained within the
things, while others contain them; some of them are
actions, and the others experiences (passions) or their
consequences.</p>

<h3>THE THREE FIRST PHYSICAL CATEGORIES OF
MATTER, FORM AND COMBINATION.</h3>

<p>Matter is something common which is found in all
<span class="locked">things;<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a></span> nevertheless it does not form a genus because
it does not admit of any differences, unless its differences
consist in appearing in different forms; as, here,
fire, and there, air. Philosophers who consider that
matter is a genus base this opinion on the fact that
matter is common to all the things in which it exists,
or that it stands in the relation of the whole to the
parts of particular objects (or, "matters"). In this
case, however, the term "genus" would be used in a
sense differing from the one it bears usually. It would
then be no more than an only or single element, if we
admit that an element can be a genus. If, conceiving
that matter is united to matter, or exists within it, we
add form to matter, matter would thereby be differentiated
from the other forms, but it will not comprehend
every being-like form. Were we to call the
generating principle of being "form," and were we to
call the reason which constitutes the form "being-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_938" id="Page_938">938</a></span>
reason," we shall not yet have clearly defined the
nature of "being." Finally, if we give the name of
"being" only to the combination of matter and form,
the result will be that neither of these two (matter or
form taken separately) will themselves be "being."
If, however, we were to assert that not only their combination,
but also each of them separately were
"being," we then would be faced with the problem of
what is common to all three.</p>

<h3>DIFFERENT PHYSICAL CATEGORIES.</h3>

<p>As to the things which are simply posited as attributes,
they should, as principles or elements, be classified
under relation. Among the accidents of things,
some, like quantity and quality, are contained within
them; while others contain them, as time and place.
Then there are actions and experiences, as movements;
then their consequences, as "being in time," and "being
in place"; the latter is the consequence of the combination,
the former is the consequence of movement.</p>

<h3>FIVE PHYSICAL CATEGORIES.</h3>

<p>We decide, therefore, that the three first things
(matter, form, and their combination) contribute to
the formation of a single genus, which, by a figure of
speech, we call ("corporeal) Being," a genus which is
common to them, and whose name applies to all three.
Then come the other genera; such as relation, quantity
and quality; the (relation of) being "contained in
place," and "in time"; movement; and place and time.
But as the category of "time" and "place" would
render superfluous that of "being in place" and of
"being in <span class="locked">time,"<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></span> we should limit ourselves to the
recognition of five genera, of which the first ("being")
comprises matter, form and the <span class="locked">combination.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></span> If,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_939" id="Page_939">939</a></span>
however, we should not count matter, form and combination
as a single genus, our analysis will assume the
following shape: matter, form, combination, relation,
quantity, quality, and movement. Otherwise, the
latter three might be subsumed under relation, which
possesses more extension than they.</p>

<h3>SENSE-BEING.</h3>

<p>4. What is the common element in these three
things (matter, form and their combination)? What
constitutes their (sublunary, mundane or) earthly
"being"? Is it because matter, form and their combination
form a foundation for other things? In that
case, as matter is the foundation, or seat of form, then
form will not be in the genus of "being." But, as the
combination also forms foundation for other things,
then form united to matter will be the subject of the
combinations, or rather, of all the things which are
posterior to the combination, as quantity, quality, and
movement.</p>

<h3>BEING IS THAT WHICH IS PREDICATED OF
NOTHING ELSE.</h3>

<p>It would seem that (physical) "being" is that which
is not predicated of anything <span class="locked">else;<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a></span> for whiteness and
blackness may, for instance, be predicated of some
white or black subject. Likewise with the idea of
"doubleness";&mdash;I mean here not the doubleness which
is the opposite of one half, but the doubleness predicated
of some subject, as when one says "this wood
is double." So also paternity, and science, are attributes
of another subject, of which that is said. So
space is that which limits, and time that which measures
something else. But fire, or wood considered as such,
are not attributes. Neither are Socrates, nor composite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_940" id="Page_940">940</a></span>
being (composed of matter and form), nor
form which is in the "being," because it is not a modification
of any other subject. Indeed, form is not an
attribute of matter; it is an element of the combination.
"Man" and "form of man" are one and the same
<span class="locked">thing.<a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a></span> Matter also is an element of the combination;
under this respect, it may be predicated of a subject,
but this subject is identical with itself. On the contrary,
whiteness, considered in itself, exists only in
the subject of which it may be predicated. Consequently,
the thing which exists only in the subject of
which it is predicated is not (physical) <span class="locked">"being."<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a></span>
"Being," on the contrary, is that which is what it is by
itself. In case it form part of some subject, then it
completes the combination; whose elements exist each
in itself, and which are predicated of the combination
only in a condition other than that of existing in it.
Considered as a part, "being" is relative to something
other than itself; but considered in itself, in its nature,
in what it is, it is not predicable of <span class="locked">anything.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a></span></p>

<h3>PHYSICAL BEING IS THE PRINCIPLE OF ALL
OTHER THINGS.</h3>

<p>To be a subject is then a property common to
matter, to form, and to the combination. But this
function of subject is fulfilled differently by matter in
respect to form, and by form in respect to the modifications,
and by the combination; or rather, matter
is not a subject in respect to form; form is the complement
which completes it when it still is only matter,
and when it exists only <span class="locked">potentially.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a></span> To speak
strictly, form is not in matter; for when one thing
forms only a unity with something else, one cannot say
that one is in the other (as some accident in its subject).
Only when both are taken together do matter
and form form a subject for other <span class="locked">things;<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></span> thus Man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_941" id="Page_941">941</a></span>
in general, and a particular man constitute the subject
of passive modifications; they are anterior to the
actions and consequences which relate to them.
"Being" therefore is the principle from which all other
things derive, and by which they exist; that to which
all passive modifications relate, and from which all
actions <span class="locked">proceed.<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a></span></p>

<h3>RELATION BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND INTELLIGIBLE
TERMS ARE MERELY VERBAL.</h3>

<p>5. Such are the characteristics of sense-being. If
in any way they also suit intelligible "being," it is only
by <span class="locked">analogy,<a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></span> or by figure of speech (homonymy).<a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a>
So, for instance, the "first" is so called in respect of the
remainder; for it is not absolutely first, but only in
respect to the things which hold an inferior rank; far
more, the things which follow the first are also called
first in respect to those which follow. Likewise, in
speaking of intelligible things, the word "subject" is
used in a different sense. It may also be doubted that
they suffer ("experience"), and it is evident that if
they do suffer, it is in an entirely different <span class="locked">manner.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a></span></p>

<h3>PHYSICAL BEING IS THAT WHICH IS NOT IN A
SUBJECT.</h3>

<p>Not to be in a subject is then the common characteristic
of all "being," if, by "not being in a subject," we
mean "not to form part of any subject," and "not to
contribute to the formation of a unity therewith."
Indeed, that which contributes to the formation of a
composite being, with something else, could not be in
that thing as in a subject; form therefore is not in
matter as in a subject, and neither is "man" in
Socrates as in a subject, because "man" forms part of
<span class="locked">Socrates.<a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a></span> Thus, "being" is that which is not in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_942" id="Page_942">942</a></span>
subject. If we add that "being" is not predicated of
any subject, we must also add, "insofar as this subject
is something different from itself;" otherwise "man,"
predicated of some one man, would not be comprised
within the definition of "being," if (in asserting that
"being" is not predicated of any subject), we did not
add, "so far as this subject is something different from
itself." When I say, "Socrates is a man," I am practically
saying, "White is white," and not, "wood is
white." While actually asserting that "Socrates is a
man," I am asserting that a particular man is a man,
and to say "The man who is in Socrates is a man,"
amounts to saying "Socrates is Socrates," or, "that
particular reasonable living organism is a living organism."</p>

<h3>ALL THE OTHER PHYSICAL CATEGORIES REFER TO
MATTER, FORM OR COMBINATION.</h3>

<p>It might however be objected that the property of
"being" does not consist in being a subject; for the
difference (as, for instance, a biped), is also one of
those things which are not in a <span class="locked">subject.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a></span> If "biped"
be considered as a part of being, we are compelled to
recognize that "biped" is not in a subject; but if by
"biped" we do not mean some particular "being" but
the property of being a biped, then we are no longer
speaking of a being, but of a quality, and "biped" will
be in a subject.</p>

<p>But time and place do not seem to be in a subject!
If we define time as "the measure of <span class="locked">movement,"<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a></span>
(there are two possibilities). First, time might be
measured movement; and then it will be in movement
as in a subject, while movement itself will be in the
moved thing. Or, time will be what measures (the
soul, or the present moment), and then it will be in
what measures as in a subject. As to space, as it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_943" id="Page_943">943</a></span>
the limit of what contains, it will also reside in what
<span class="locked">contains.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a></span> It is otherwise with the "being" that we
are here considering. "Being," then, will have to be
considered as consisting in either one, or in several,
or in all the properties of which we are speaking;
because these properties simultaneously suit matter,
form, and the combination.</p>

<h3>BEING DRAWS ITS EXISTENCE FROM THE
INTELLIGIBLE.</h3>

<p>6. It may perhaps be objected that we have here
indicated the properties of "being," but we have not
described its nature. Such a request amounts to asking
to see what sense-being is; now sense-being is,
and "being" is not something which can be seen.</p>

<p>What then? Are fire and water not beings? Doubtless,
they are. But are they beings merely because
they are visible? No. Is it because they contain
matter? No. Is it because they have a form? No.
Is it because they are combinations? No. They are
"beings," because they "are."</p>

<p>But one can also say that quantity, as well as that
quality "is!" Yes, doubtless, but if we speak thus
about quantity and quality, it is only by a figure of
<span class="locked">speech.<a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a>,<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a></span>, <a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a></p>

<p>Then, in what consists the being of earth, fire, and
other similar things? What is the difference between
the being of these things and of others? The essence
of the earth, of the fire, and so forth, exists in an absolute
manner, while the essence of other things (is
relative) and for instance, means merely being white.
"Is" added to white is not the same thing as "essence"
taken absolutely; is it? Certainly not. Essence taken
absolutely is essence in the first degree; "to be" added
to white, is essence by participation, essence in the
second degree; for "to be," added to white, makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_944" id="Page_944">944</a></span>
white an essence; and white added to essence makes
the being white; that is why white is an accident for
essence, and "to be" an accident to white. It is not
the same thing as if we said, Socrates is white, and, the
White is Socrates; for in both cases Socrates is the
same being; but it is not thus with whiteness; for, in
the second case, Socrates is contained in the white,
and in the first case, white is a pure accident. When
we say, the being is white, the white is an accident of
being; but when we say, the White is essence, the white
contains essence. In short, white possesses existence
only because it refers to "being," and is in "being."
It is therefore from "being" that it receives its existence.
On the contrary, essence draws its existence
from itself; and from white it receives whiteness, not
because it is in the white, but because the white is
within <span class="locked">it.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a></span> As the essence which is in the sense-world
is not Essence by itself, we must say that it draws its
existence from the veritable Essence, in itself; and,
finally, the White in itself possesses essence because it
participates in the intelligible Essence.</p>

<h3>BEING CANNOT BE ASCRIBED TO MATTER, WHICH
DERIVES ITS BEING FROM THE INTELLIGIBLE.</h3>

<p>7. If somebody should object that material things
derive their essence from matter, we should have to
ask from whence matter itself draws its essence and
existence; for we have elsewhere demonstrated that
matter does not hold the first <span class="locked">rank.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a></span></p>

<p>If, however, it be further objected, that the other
things could not exist without being in matter, we will
answer that that is true only for sense-things. But
if matter be anterior to sense-things, that does not
hinder itself being posterior to many other things, and
to all intelligible things; for the existence of matter is
far more obscure than the things in matter, if these
things be ("seminal) reasons," which participate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_945" id="Page_945">945</a></span>
deeper in essence, while matter is completely irrational,
being an adumbration, and a decay of <span class="locked">reason.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a></span></p>

<p>It may further be objected that matter gives essence
to material things, as Socrates gives essence to the
white that is in him. We will answer that what possesses
a superior degree of Essence may well confer a
lesser degree of essence to what possesses a still inferior
degree thereof, but that the reciprocal or converse
condition is impossible. Now, as form is more essence
than <span class="locked">matter,<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a></span> essence cannot be predicated
equally of matter and form, and "being" is not a genus
whose species is matter, form and the <span class="locked">combination.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a></span>
These three things have several common characteristics,
as we have already said, but they differ in respect
to essence; for when something which possesses
a superior degree of essence approaches something
which possesses an inferior degree (as when form approaches
matter), this thing, although anterior in (the
ontological) order, is posterior in respect to being;
consequently, if matter, form and the combination
be not "beings" equally, no longer is being for them
something common, like a genus. Nevertheless,
"being" will be in a less narrow relation with things
which are posterior to matter, to form, and to the
combination, though it gives each of them the property
of belonging to themselves. It is thus that life has
different degrees, one stronger, the other weaker, and
that the images of a same object are some more lively,
others more <span class="locked">obscure.<a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a></span> If essence be measured by a
lower degree of essence, and if the superior degree
which exists in other things be omitted, essence thus
considered will be a common element. But that is not a
good way of procedure. Indeed, each whole differs
from the others, and the lesser degree of essence does
not constitute something that was common to all;
just as, for life, there is not something common to
vegetative life, to sensitive life, and rational <span class="locked">life.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_946" id="Page_946">946</a></span></p>

<h3>ESSENCES DIFFER ACCORDING TO PARTICIPATION
IN FORM.</h3>

<p>Consequently, essence differs both in matter and in
form; and these two (entities) depend from a third
(intelligible Being), which communicates itself to them
unequally. The anterior Being possesses a better
nature ("essence") than any posterior being, not only
when the second proceeds from the first, and the third
from the second; but when two things proceed from
one and the same thing, the same (condition of affairs)
may be observed. Thus does the clay (when
fashioned by the potter) become a tile not only according
as it participates in the fire more or less (is
more or less thoroughly baked). Besides, matter and
form do not proceed from the same intelligible <span class="locked">principle;<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a></span>
for the intelligibles also differ among each
other.</p>

<h3>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MATTER AND FORM DUE TO
THAT OF INTELLIGIBLE ENTITIES FROM
WHICH THEY DEPEND.</h3>

<p>8. Besides, it is not necessary to divide the combination
in form and matter, now that we speak of
sense-being, a "being" which has to be perceived by
the senses, rather than by reason. Neither is it necessary
to add of what this being is composed; for the elements
which compose it are not beings, or at least not
sense-beings. What has to be done here is to embrace
in a single genus what is common to stone, to earth,
to water, and to the things compounded of them;
namely, to plants and animals so far as they respond
to sensation. In this way, we shall consider both form
and matter; for sense-being contains them both. Thus
fire, earth, and their intermediaries are both matter and
form; as to the combinations, they contain several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_947" id="Page_947">947</a></span>
beings united together. What then is the common
characteristic of all these beings, which separates them
from other things? They serve as subjects to other
things, and are not contained in one subject, and do
not belong to something <span class="locked">else;<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></span> in short, all the characteristics
we have enumerated above suit sense-being.</p>

<h3>SENSE-BEING CONSISTS IN THE REUNION OF
QUALITIES AND MATTER.</h3>

<p>But how shall we separate the accidents from sense-being,
if it have no existence without dimension or
quality? Of what will sense-being consist, if we remove
from it dimension, figure (or outward appearance),
color, dryness, and humidity? For sense-beings
are qualified. The qualities which change simple into
qualified "being" refer to something. Thus, it is not
the entire fire which is being, but something of the fire,
one of its parts. Now what is this part, if it be not
matter? Sense-being, therefore, consists in the reunion
of quality and matter; and being is constituted by
the totality of these things blended in a single matter.
Each thing taken separately will be quality or quantity,
and so forth; but the thing whose absence makes
"being" incomplete is a part of that being. As to the
thing which is added to already complete being, it has
its own <span class="locked">place;<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a></span> and it is not lost in the blending which
constitutes "being." I do not say that such a thing,
taken with others, is a being when it completes a
matter of some particular size and quality, and that it is
no more than a quality when it does not complete this
mass; I say that even here below not everything is
"being," and that only the totality which embraces
everything is "being." Let none complain that we are
constituting "being" as of that which is not being; for
even the totality is not a veritable "being." (Here this
word is used in both sensual and intelligible senses, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_948" id="Page_948">948</a></span>
a pun), and only offers the image of the veritable
(Being), which possesses essence independently of all
that refers to it, and itself produces the other things
because it possesses veritable (Existence). Here below
the substrate possesses essence only incompletely, and,
far from producing other things, is sterile; it is only an
adumbration, and onto this adumbration are reflected
images which have only the appearance (instead of
real existence.)<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a></p>

<h3>CLASSIFICATION OF BODIES.</h3>

<p>9. So much then for what we had to say of sense-being,
and the genus it constitutes. It remains to
analyze it into species. Every sense-being is a body;
but there are elementary and organized bodies; the
former are fire, earth, water and air; the organized
bodies are those of plants and animals, which are distinguished
from each other by their forms. The earth
and the other elements may be divided into species.
Plants and bodies of animals may be classified according
to their forms; or we could classify apart the terrestrial
animals, that inhabit the earth, and those which
belong to some other element. We might also analyze
bodies into those that are light, heavy, or intermediary;
the heavy bodies remaining in the middle of the world,
the light bodies in the superior region which surrounds
the world, and the intermediary bodies dwelling in the
intermediary region. In each one of these regions the
bodies are distinguished by their exterior appearance
(or, figure); thus there exist the bodies of the (stars,
or) celestial bodies, and then those that belong to
particular elements. After having distributed the
bodies according to the four elements, they could be
blended together in some other manner, and thus beget
their mutual differences of location, forms, and mixtures.
Bodies could also be distinguished as fiery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_949" id="Page_949">949</a></span>
terrestrial, and so forth, according to their predominating
element.</p>

<h3>PRIMARY AND SECONDARY BEINGS ARE DIVIDED
BY NO SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE.</h3>

<p>As to the distinction drawn between primary and
secondary <span class="locked">being,<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a></span> it must be admitted that some particular
fire, and the universal Fire differ from each
other in this, that the one is individual, and the other
universal; but the difference between them does not
seem to be essential. Indeed, does the genus of quality
contain both White, and a particular white; or Grammar,
and some particular grammatical science? How
far does Grammatical science then have less reality
than some particular grammatical science, and Science,
than some particular science? Grammatical science is
not posterior to some particular grammatical science;
Grammatical science must already have existed before
the existence of the grammatical science in you, since
the latter is some grammatical science because it is
found in you; it is besides identical with universal
Grammatical science. Likewise, it is not Socrates that
caused him who was not a man to become a man; it is
rather the universal Man who enabled Socrates to be a
man; for the individual man is man by participation in
the universal Man. What then is Socrates, if not some
man? In what does such a man contribute to render
"being" more "being"? If the answer be that he contributes
thereto by the fact that the universal Man
is only a form, while a particular man is a form in
matter, the result will only be that a particular man
will be less of a man; for reason (that is, essence) is
weaker when it is in matter. If the universal Man consist
not only in form itself, but is also in matter, in what
will he be inferior to the form of the man who is in
matter, since it will be the reason of the man which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_950" id="Page_950">950</a></span>
in matter? By its nature the universal is anterior, and
consequently the form is anterior to the individual.
Now that which by its nature is anterior is an absolute
anterior. How then would the universal be less in
being? Doubtless the individual, being better known
to us, is anterior for us; but no difference in the things
themselves <span class="locked">results.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a></span> Besides, if we were to admit
the distinction between primary and secondary beings,
the definition of "being" would no longer be one; for
that which is first and that which is second are not comprised
under one single definition, and do not form a
single and same genus.</p>

<h3>BODIES MAY BE CLASSIFIED NOT ONLY BY FORMS;
BUT BY QUALITIES; ETC.</h3>

<p>10. Bodies may also be distinguished by heat or
dryness, wetness or cold, or in any other desired manner,
by taking two qualities simultaneously, then considering
these things as a composition and mixture, and
ceasing at the combination thereof. Or, bodies may be
divided in terrestrial bodies, that dwell on the earth, or
distribute them according to their forms, and the differences
of animals; by classifying not the animals
themselves, but their bodies, which are their <span class="locked">instruments,<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a></span>
as it were. It is proper to establish a classification
according to the forms, as it is equally reasonable
to classify bodies according to their qualities, such
as heat, cold, and so forth. If it be objected that
bodies are constituted rather by their qualities, it may
be answered that they are just as much classified by
their blends, their colors, and their figures. When
analyzing sense-being, it is not unreasonable to classify
it according to the differences that appear to the
<span class="locked">senses.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a></span> This ("being") does not possess absolute
(Essence); it is the totality of the matter and qualities
which constitutes the sense-being, since we have said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_951" id="Page_951">951</a></span>
that its hypostatic existence consists in the union of
the things perceived by the senses, and that it is according
to the testimony of their senses that men
believe in the existence of things.</p>

<h3>BODIES ARE CLASSIFIABLE ACCORDING TO
SPECIFIC FORMS.</h3>

<p>The composition of the bodies being varied, they
may also be classified according to the specific forms
of the animals. Such, for instance, would be the
specific form of a man united to a body; for this form
is a quality of body, and it is reasonable to analyze it
according to the qualities. If it should be objected that
we have said above that some bodies are simple, while
others are composite, thus contrasting the simple and
the composite, we shall answer that, without regarding
their composition, we have also said that they are either
brute or organized. The classification of bodies should
not be founded on the contrast between the simple and
the composite, but, as we first did, we may classify the
simple bodies in the first rank. Then, by considering
their blendings, one may start from another principle
to determine the differences offered by the composites
under the respect of their figure or their location; thus,
for instance, bodies might be classified in celestial and
terrestrial. This may close our consideration of sense-being,
or generation.</p>

<h3>DEFINITION OF QUANTITY.</h3>

<p>11. Let us now pass to quantity and quantitatives.
When treating of quantity, we have already said that
it consists in number and dimension, in so far as some
thing possesses such a quantity, that is, in the number
of material things, and in the extension of the <span class="locked">subject.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a></span>
Here indeed we are not treating of abstract
quantity, but of a quantity which causes a piece of
wood to measure three feet, or that horses are five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_952" id="Page_952">952</a></span>
in number. Consequently, as we have said, we should
call extension and number (considered from the concrete
viewpoint) "quantitatives"; but this name could
could be applied neither to time nor space; time, being
the measure of <span class="locked">movement,<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a></span> re-enters into relation;
and place, being that which contains the <span class="locked">body,<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a></span> consists
of a manner of being, and consequently, in a relation.
(So much the less should we call time and
place "quantitatives," as) movement, though continuous,
does not either belong to the genus of quantity.</p>

<h3>LARGE AND SMALL ARE CONCEPTIONS BELONGING
TO QUANTITY.</h3>

<p>Should "large" and "small" be classified within the
genus of quantity? Yes: for the large is large by a
certain dimension, and dimension is not a relation.
As to "greater" and "smaller," they belong to relation;
for a thing is greater or smaller in relation to something
else, just as when it is double. Why then do
we sometimes say that a mountain is large, and that a
grain of millet is small? When we say that a mountain
is small, we use the latter term instead of smaller;
for they who use this expression themselves acknowledge
that they call a mountain small only by comparing
it to other mountains, which implies that here
"little" stands for "smaller." Likewise, when we say
that a grain of millet is large, this does not mean
"large" in any absolute sense, but large only for a
grain of millet; which implies that one compares it to
things of the same kind, and that here "large" means
<span class="locked">"larger."<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></span></p>

<h3>BEAUTY IS CLASSIFIED ALONG WITH THE
RELATIVES.</h3>

<p>Why then do we not also classify the beautiful
among the relatives? Because beauty is such by itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_953" id="Page_953">953</a></span>
because it constitutes a quality, while "more beautiful"
is a relative. Nevertheless the thing which is called
beautiful would sometimes appear ugly, if it were compared
to some other, as, for instance, if we were to
contrast the beauty of men with that of the gods;
hence the expression (of <span class="locked">Heraclitus's<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a></span>): "The most
beautiful of monkeys would be ugly if compared with
an animal of a different kind." When beauty is predicated
of something, it is considered in itself; it might
perhaps be called more beautiful or more ugly if it
were compared to another. Hence it results that, in
the genus of which we are treating, an object is in
itself great because of the presence of greatness, but
not in respect to some other. Otherwise, we would
be obliged to deny that a thing was beautiful because
of the existence of some more beautiful one. Neither
therefore must we deny that a thing is great because
there is only one greater than it; for "greater" could
not exist without "great," any more than "more
beautiful" without "beautiful."</p>

<p>QUANTITY ADMITS OF CONTRARIES (POLEMIC
AGAINST ARISTOTLE).<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<p>12. It must therefore be admitted that quantity
admits of contraries. Even our thought admits of contraries
when we say "great" and "small," since we
then conceive of contraries, as when we say, "much
and little"; for much and little are in the same condition
as great and small. Sometimes it is said, "At
home there are many people," and by this is intended
a (relatively) great number; for in the latter case it
is a relative. Likewise it is said, "There are few
people in the theatre," instead of saying, "there are
less people," (relatively); but when one uses the word
"many" a great multitude in number must be understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_954" id="Page_954">954</a></span></p>

<h3>HOW MULTITUDE IS CLASSIFIED WITH RELATIVES.</h3>

<p>How then is multitude classified among relatives? It
forms part of relatives in that multitude is an extension
of number, while its contrary is a contraction. Likewise
is it with continuous dimension; we conceive of
it as prolonged. Quantity therefore has a double
origin: progression of unity, and of the point. If
either progression cease promptly, the first one produces
"little," and the second, "small." If both be
prolonged, they produce "much," and "large." What
then is the limit that determines these things? The
same question may be asked about the beautiful, and
about warmth; for there is also "warmer"; only, the
latter is a relative, while Warm, taken absolutely, is a
quality. As there is a "reason" of the beautiful (a
reason that would produce and determine the beautiful),
likewise there must be a reason for the Great, a
reason by participation in which an object becomes
great, as the reason of the Beautiful makes beautiful.
Such are the things for which quantity admits contraries.</p>

<h3>THERE IS NO CONTRARY FOR PLACE.</h3>

<p>For space, there is no contrary, because strictly
space does not belong to the genus of quantity. Even
if space were part of quantity, "high" would not be the
contrary of anything unless the universe contained also
"low." The terms high and low, applied to parts,
signify only higher and lower than something else. It
is so also with right and left, which are relatives.</p>

<h3>CLASSIFICATION OF SYLLABLES AND SPEECH.</h3>

<p>Syllables and speech are quantitatives; they might
be subjects in respect to quantity, but only so by accident.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_955" id="Page_955">955</a></span>
Indeed, the voice, by itself, is a <span class="locked">movement,<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></span>
it must therefore be reduced to movement and action.</p>

<h3>DISCRETE QUANTITY QUITE DISTINCT FROM
CONTINUOUS QUANTITY.</h3>

<p>13. We have already explained that discrete quantity
is clearly distinguished from continuous quantity,
both by its own definition, and the general definition
(for quantity).<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> We may add that numbers are distinguished
from each other by being even and odd.
If besides there be other differences amidst the even
and odd numbers, these differences will have to be referred
to the objects in which are the numbers, or to
the numbers composed of unities, and not any more
to those which exist in sense-beings. If reason separate
sense-things from the numbers they contain, nothing
hinders us then from attributing to these numbers the
same differences (as to the numbers composed of
unities).<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a></p>

<h3>ELEMENTS OF CONTINUOUS QUANTITY.</h3>

<p>What distinctions are admitted by continuous quantity?
There is the line, the surface, and the solid; for
extension may exist in one, two or three dimensions
(and thus count the numerical elements of continuous
size) instead of establishing <span class="locked">species.<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></span> In numbers
thus considered as anterior or posterior to each other,
there is nothing in common, which would constitute a
genus. Likewise in the first, second and third increases
(of a line, surface, and solid) there is nothing in common;
but as far as quantity is found, there is also
equality (and inequality), although there be no extension
which is quantitative more than any <span class="locked">other.<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a></span>
However, one may have dimensions greater than another.
It is therefore only in so far as they are all
numbers, that numbers can have anything in common.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_956" id="Page_956">956</a></span>
Perhaps, indeed, it is not the monad that begets the
pair, nor the pair that begets the triad, but it may
be the same principle which begets all the numbers.
If numbers be not derivative, but exist by themselves,
we may, at least within our own thought, consider them
as begotten (or, derivative). We conceive of the
smaller number as the anterior, the greater as posterior.
But numbers, as such, may all be reduced to unity.</p>

<h3>STUDY OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES.</h3>

<p>The method of classification adopted for numbers
may be applied to sizes, and thus distinguish the line,
the surface, and the solid or body, because those are
sizes which form different species. If besides each of
these species were to be divided, lines might be subdivided
into straight, curved and spiral; surfaces into
straight and curved; solids into round or polyhedral
bodies. Further, as geometers do, may come the triangle,
the quadrilateral, and others.</p>

<h3>STUDY OF THE STRAIGHT LINE.</h3>

<p>14. But what about the straight line? Is it not a
magnitude? Possibly; but if it be a magnitude, it is a
qualified <span class="locked">one.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a></span> It is even possible that straightness
constitutes a difference of the (very nature of the)
line, as line, for straightness refers solely to a line;
and besides, we often deduce the differences of "Essence"
from its qualities. That a straight line is a
quantity added to a difference does not cause its being
composed of the line, and of the property of straightness;
for, were it thus composed, straightness would
be its chief difference.</p>

<h3>STUDY OF THE TRIANGLE.</h3>

<p>Now let us consider the triangle, which is formed of
three lines. Why should it not belong to quantity?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_957" id="Page_957">957</a></span>
Would it be so, because it is not constituted by three
lines merely, but by three lines arranged in some particular
manner? But a quadrilateral would also be
constituted by four lines arranged in some particular
manner. (But being arranged in some particular manner
does not hinder a figure from being a quantity).
The straight line, indeed, is arranged in some particular
manner, and is none the less a quantity. Now if the
straight line be not simply a quantity, why could this
not also be said of a limited line? For the limit of the
line is a point, and the point does not belong to any
genus other than the line. Consequently, a limited
surface is also a quantity, because it is limited by lines,
which even more belong to quantity. If then the
limited surface be contained in the genus of quantity,
whether the surface be a triangle, a quadrilateral, a
hexagon, or any other polygon, all figures whatever
will belong to the genus of quantity. But if we assigned
the triangle or quadrilateral to the genus of
quality merely because we are speaking of some one
definite triangle or quadrilateral, nothing would hinder
one and the same thing from being subsumed under
several categories. A triangle would then be a quantity
so far as it was both a general and particular magnitude,
and would be a quality by virtue of its possessing
a particular form. The same might be predicated
of the Triangle in itself because of its possessing a particular
form; and so also with the sphere. By following
this line of argument, geometry would be turned into
a study of qualities, instead of that of quantities, which
of course it is. The existing differences between magnitudes
do not deprive them of their property of being
magnitudes, just as the difference between essences
does not affect their essentiality. Besides, every surface
is limited, because an infinite surface is impossible.
Further, when I consider a difference that pertains to
essence, I call it an essential difference. So much the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_958" id="Page_958">958</a></span>
more, on considering figures, I am considering differences
of magnitude. For if the differences were not
of magnitude, of what would they be differences?
If then they be differences of magnitude, the different
magnitudes which are derived from differences of magnitude
should be classified according to the species
constituted by them (when considered in the light of
being magnitudes).</p>

<h3>GEOMETRY STUDIES QUANTITIES, NOT QUALITIES.</h3>

<p>15. But how can you qualify the properties of
quantity so as to call them equal or unequal?<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> Is it
not usual to say of two triangles that they are similar?
Could we not also predicate similarity of two magnitudes?
Doubtless, for what is called <span class="locked">similarity,<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a></span> does
not conflict with similarity or dissimilarity in the genus
of <span class="locked">quantity.<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></span> Here, indeed, the word "similarity" is
applied to magnitudes in a sense other than to quality.
Besides, if (Aristotle) said that the property characteristic
of quantities is to enable them to be called equal
or unequal, this does not conflict with predicating
similarity of some of them. But as it has been said that
the special characteristic of qualities is to admit of
being called similar or dissimilar, we must, as has
already been explained, understand similarity in a
sense other than when it is applied to magnitudes. If
similar magnitudes be identical, we must then consider
the other properties of quantity and quality which
might be present in them (so as clearly to contrast their
differences). It may also be said that the term
"similarity" applies to the genus of quantity so far as
this contains differences (which distinguish from each
other similar magnitudes).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_959" id="Page_959">959</a></span></p>

<h3>DIFFERENCES WHICH COMPLETE THE BEING MUST
BE PREFIXED TO THAT TO WHICH THEY REFER.</h3>

<p>In general, the differences which complete a being
should be classified along with that of which they are
the differences, especially when a difference belongs
to a single subject. If a difference complete the being
of a subject, and do not complete the being of another,
this difference should be classified along with the subject
whose being it completes, leaving that whose
being it does not complete for separate consideration.
By this we do not mean completing the Being in
general, but completing some particular being, so that
the subject spoken of as a particular one admits no
further essential addition. We therefore have the right
to say that triangles, or that quadrilaterals, as well as
surfaces and solids, are equal, and to predicate equality
or inequality of quantitative entities. But we yet
have to study whether quality only can be said to
be similar or <span class="locked">dissimilar.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a></span></p>

<h3>WHETHER QUALITY ONLY CAN BE CALLED
SIMILAR OR DISSIMILAR.</h3>

<p>When we were treating of things that were qualified,
we had already explained that matter, united to quantity,
and taken with other things, constitutes sense-being;
that this "being" seems to be a composite of
several things, that it is not properly a <span class="locked">"whatness,"<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></span>
but rather qualification (or, qualified thing). The
("seminal) reason," for instance that of fire, has more
of a reference to "whatness," while the form that the
reason begets is rather a qualification. Likewise, the
("seminal) reason" of man is a "whatness," whilst
the form that this reason gives to the body, being only
an image of reason, is rather a qualification. Thus if
the Socrates that we see was the genuine Socrates, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_960" id="Page_960">960</a></span>
mere portrait composed of no more than colors would
also be called Socrates. Likewise, although this ("seminal)
reason" of Socrates be that which constitutes the
genuine Socrates, we nevertheless also apply the name
of Socrates to the man that we see; yet the colors,
or the figure of the Socrates we see, are only the image
of those which are contained by his ("seminal)
reason." Likewise, the reason of Socrates is itself only
an image of the veritable reason (of the idea) of the
man. This is our solution of the <span class="locked">problem.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a></span></p>

<h3>THE VARIOUS TERMS EXPRESSING QUALITY.</h3>

<p>16. When we separately consider each of the
things which compose sense-being and when we wish
to designate the quality which exists among them, we
must not call it "whatness," any more than quantity or
movement, but rather name it a characteristic, employing
the expressions "such," "as," and "this kind."
We are thus enabled to indicate beauty and ugliness,
such as they are in the body. Indeed, sense-beauty is
no more than a figure of <span class="locked">speech,<a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></span> in respect to intelligible
beauty; it is likewise with quality, since black
and white are also completely different (from their
"reason," or their idea).</p>

<h3>THE SEMINAL REASON HARMONIZES WITH ITS
APPEARING ACTUALIZATION.</h3>

<p>Is the content of ("seminal) reason" and of a particular
reason, identical with what appears, or does it
apply thereto only by a figure of speech?<a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> Should
it properly be classified among the intelligible, or the
sense-objects? Sensual beauty of course evidently
differs from intelligible beauty; but what of ugliness&mdash;in
which classification does it belong? Must virtue
be classified among intelligible or sensual qualities, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_961" id="Page_961">961</a></span>
should we locate some in each class? (All this uncertainty
is excusable, inasmuch) as it may be asked
whether even the arts, which are "reasons," should
be classified among sense-qualities? If these reasons
be united to a matter, they must have matter as their
very soul. But what is their condition here below,
when united to some matter? These reasons are in a
case similar to song accompanied by a <span class="locked">lyre;<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a></span> this
song, being uttered by a sense-voice, is in relation
with the strings of the lyre, while simultaneously being
part of the art (which is one of these "seminal
reasons"). Likewise, it might be said that virtues are
actualizations, and not parts (of the soul). Are they
sense-actualizations? (This seems probable), for
although the beauty contained in the body be incorporeal,
we still classify it among the things which refer
to the body, and belong to it. As to arithmetic, and
geometry, two different kinds must be distinguished:
the first kind deals with visible objects, and must be
classified among sense-objects; but the second kind
deals with studies suitable to the soul, and should therefore
be classified among intelligible entities. <span class="locked">Plato<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a></span>
considers that music and astronomy are in the same
condition.</p>

<h3>MANY OTHER CONCEPTIONS BELONG AMONG
SENSE-QUALITIES.</h3>

<p>Thus the arts which relate to the body, which make
use of the organs, and which consult the senses, are
really dispositions of the soul, but only of the soul as
applied to corporeal objects; and consequently, they
should be classified among <span class="locked">sense-qualities.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a></span> Here
also belong practical virtues, such as are implied by
civil duties, and which, instead of raising the soul to
intelligible entities, fructify in the actions of political
life, and refer to them, not as a necessity of our condition,
but as an occupation preferable to everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_962" id="Page_962">962</a></span>
<span class="locked">else.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a></span> Among these qualities we shall have to classify
the beauty contained in the ("seminal) reason," and,
so much the more, black and white.</p>

<h3>IN SPITE OF THIS CLASSIFICATION THE SOUL
HERSELF REMAINS INCORPOREAL.</h3>

<p>But is the soul herself a sense-being, if she be disposed
in a particular way, and if she contain particular
"reasons" (that is, faculties, virtues, sciences and arts,
all of which refer to the body, and which have been
classified as sense-qualities)?<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> It has already been explained
that these "reasons" themselves are not corporeal;
but that they have been classified among sense-qualities
only because they referred to the body, and
to the actions thereby produced. On the other hand,
as sense-quality has been defined as the meeting of all
the above enumerated entities, it is impossible to
classify incorporeal Being in the same genus as the
sensual being. As to the qualities of the soul, they are
all doubtless incorporeal, but as they are experiences
(or, sufferings, or, passions) which refer to terrestrial
things, they must be classified in the genus of quality,
just as the reasons of the individual soul. Of the soul
we must therefore predicate experience, however dividing
the latter in two elements, one of which would refer
to the object to which it is applied, and the other to the
subject in which it <span class="locked">exists.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a></span> Though then these experiences
cannot be considered as corporeal qualities,
yet it must be admitted they relate to the <span class="locked">body.<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a></span> On
the other hand, although we classify these experiences
in the genus of quality, still the soul herself should not
be reduced to the rank of corporeal being. Last, when
we conceive of the soul as without experiences, and
without the "reasons" above-mentioned, we are thereby
classifying her along with the World from which she
<span class="locked">descends,<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a></span> and we leave here below no intelligible
being, of any kind whatever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_963" id="Page_963">963</a></span></p>

<h3>QUALITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS CORPOREAL AND
OF THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>17. Qualities, therefore, should be classified as
of the body, and of the <span class="locked">soul.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a></span> Even though all the
souls, as well as their immaterial qualities, be considered
as existing on high, yet their inferior qualities
must be divided according to the senses, referring these
qualities either to sight, hearing, feeling, taste, or
smell. Under sight, we will classify the differences of
colors; under hearing, that of the sounds; and likewise,
with the other senses. As to the sounds, inasmuch
as they have but a single quality, they will have
to be classified according to their being soft, harsh,
agreeable, and the like.</p>

<h3>DIFFERENCES OF BEING SHOULD BE DISTINGUISHED
ACCORDING TO QUALITY.</h3>

<p>It is by quality that we distinguish the differences
which inhere in being, as well as the actualizations, the
beautiful or ugly actions, and in general, all that is
particular. Only very rarely do we discover in quantity
differences which constitute species; so much is
this the case, that it is generally divided by its characteristic
qualities. We must therefore leave quantity
aside, and that leads us to wonder how we may divide
quality itself (since it is made use of to distinguish
other things).<a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></p>

<h3>DIFFERENCE OF QUALITY CANNOT BE DISTINGUISHED
BY SENSATION.</h3>

<p>What sort of differences, indeed, might we use to
establish such divisions, and from what genus would
we draw them? It seems absurd to classify quality by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_964" id="Page_964">964</a></span>
quality itself. This is just as if the difference of
"beings" were to be called "beings." By what indeed
could one distinguish white from black, and colors
from tastes and sensations of touch? If we distinguish
the difference of these qualities by the sense-organs,
these differences would no longer exist in the subjects.
How indeed could one and the same sense distinguish
the difference of the qualities it perceives? Is it
because certain things exercise an action that is constructive
or destructive on the eyes, or the tongue?
We would then have to ask what is the constructive
or destructive element in the sensations thus excited?
Yet, even were this answered, such an answer would
not explain wherein these things <span class="locked">differ.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></span></p>

<h3>DIFFERENCE IN EFFECTS IS LIMITED TO THE
INTELLIGIBLES.</h3>

<p>A further possibility is that these things should be
classified according to their effects, and that it is
reasonable to do so with invisible entities, such as
sciences; but this would not be applicable to sense-objects.
When indeed we divide sciences by their
effects, and when, in general, we classify them according
to the powers of the soul, by concluding from the
diversity of their effects that they differ, our mind
grasps the difference of these powers, and it determines
not only with what objects they deal, but it also defines
their reason (or, essence). Let us admit that it is
easy to distinguish arts according to their reasons, and
according to the notions they include; but is it possible
to divide corporeal qualities in that manner?
Even when one studies the intelligible world, there is
room for doubt as to how the different reasons distinguish
themselves from each other; it is easy enough
to see that white differs from black; but in what does
it do so?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_965" id="Page_965">965</a></span></p>

<h3>IT IS ABSURD TO DISTINGUISH BEING, QUALITIES
AND DIFFERENCES BY THEMSELVES.</h3>

<p>18. All the questions we have asked show that we
doubtless must seek to discover the differences of the
various (beings), so as to distinguish them from each
other; but that it is as impossible as it is unreasonable
to inquire what are the differences of the differences
<span class="locked">themselves.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a></span> Being of beings, quantities of quantities,
qualities of qualities, differences of differences cannot
be discovered; but we should, wherever possible,
classify exterior objects, either according to their effects,
or according to salient characteristics. When
this is impossible, objects should be distinguished, as
for instance dark from light green.</p>

<p>But how is white distinguished from black? Sensation
or intelligence tell us that those things are different
without informing us of their reason; either
sensation, because its function is not to set forth the
reason of things, but only to bring them somehow to
our attention; or intelligence, because it discerns things
that are simple by intuition, without having to resort
to ratiocination, and limits itself to the statement that
something is such or such. Besides, in each one of
the operations of intelligence there is a difference (a
special distinctive characteristic) which enables it to
distinguish different things, without this difference
(which is proper to each of the operations of intelligence)
itself having need to be discerned by the help
of some other difference.</p>

<h3>SOME QUALITIES ARE DIFFERENCES.</h3>

<p>Are all qualities differences, or not? Whiteness,
colors, qualities perceived by touch and taste, may
become differences between different objects, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_966" id="Page_966">966</a></span>
they themselves be species. But how do the sciences
of grammar or of music constitute differences? The
science of grammar renders the mind grammatical,
and the science of music renders the mind musical,
especially if they be untaught; and these thus become
specific differences. Besides, we have to consider
whether a difference be drawn from the same genus
(from which the considered things are drawn), or
from some other genus. If it be drawn from the same
genus, it fulfils, for the things of this genus, the same
function as does a quality to the quality to which it
serves as difference. Such are virtue and vice; virtue
is a particular habit, and vice is also a particular habit;
consequently, as habits are qualities, the differences
of these habits (either of virtue or vice) will be qualities.
It may perhaps be objected that a habit without
difference is not a quality, and that it is the difference
alone which constitutes the <span class="locked">quality.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a></span> We will answer
that it is (commonly) said that sweet is good, and that
bitter is bad; this then implies a recognition of their
difference by a habit (a manner of being), and not by
a quality.</p>

<p>What if sweet be said to be "crude," or thick and
bitter, thin or refined? The answer is that coarseness
does not inform us of the nature of sweetness, but indicates
a manner of being of what is sweet; and
similarly, with what is refined.</p>

<h3>THERE ARE DIFFERENCES WHICH ARE NOT
QUALITIES.</h3>

<p>There remains for us to examine if a difference of
a quality never be a quality, as that of a being is not
a being, nor that of a quantity, a quantity. Does five
differ from three by two? No: five does not differ
from three, it only exceeds it by two. How indeed
could five differ from three by two, when five contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_967" id="Page_967">967</a></span>
two? Likewise, a movement does not differ from a
movement by a movement. As to virtue and vice,
here is one whole opposed to another whole, and it is
thus that the wholes are distinguished. If a distinction
were drawn from the same genus, that is, from quality,
instead of founding itself on another genus; as, for
instance, if one said that such a vice referred to
pleasures, some other to anger, some other to acquisitiveness,
and if one were to admit that such a
classification was good; it would evidently result that
there are differences that are not qualities.</p>

<h3>VARIOUS DERIVATIVES OF THE CATEGORY OF
QUALITY.</h3>

<p>19. As has been indicated above, the genus of quality
contains the (beings) which are said to be qualified
(qualitative entities), inasmuch as they contain some
quality (as, for instance, the handsome man, so far as
he is endowed with beauty).<a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> These (beings) however
do not properly belong to this genus, for otherwise
there would here be two categories. It suffices
to reduce them to the quality which supplies their name.</p>

<p>So non-whiteness, if it indicate some color other
than white, is a quality; if it express merely a negation,
or an enumeration, it is only a word, or a term which
recalls the object; if it be a word, it constitutes a movement
(so far as it is produced by the vocal organ);
if it be a name or a term, it constitutes, so far as it is a
significative, a relative. If things be classed not only
by genera, if it be admitted that each assertion and
expression proclaim a genus, our answer must be that
some affirm things by their mere announcement, and
that others deny them. It may perhaps be best not to
include negations in the same genus as things themselves,
since, to avoid mingling several genera, we
often do not include affirmations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_968" id="Page_968">968</a></span>
As to privations, it may be remarked that if the
things of which there are privations are qualities, then
the privations themselves are qualities, as "toothless,"
or <span class="locked">"blind."<a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a></span> But "naked" and (its contrary)
"clothed" are neither of them qualities; they rather
constitute habits, and thus belong among relatives.</p>

<p>Passion, at the moment it is felt, does not constitute
a quality, but a movement; when it has been
experienced, and has become durable, it forms a <span class="locked">quality;<a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a></span>
further, if the (being) which has experienced
the passion have kept none of it, it will have to be
described as having been moved, which amounts to the
same thing as really being moved. However, in this
case, the conception of time will have to be abstracted
from that of movement; for we must not add the conception
of the present to that of <span class="locked">movement.<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, (the adverb) "well," and the other analogous
terms may be reduced to the simple notion of
the genus of quality.</p>

<p>It remains to examine if we must refer to the genus
of quality "being red" without also doing so for <span class="locked">"reddening"<a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a></span>
for "blushing" does not belong to it, because
he who blushes suffers (experiences), or is
moved. But as soon as he ceases blushing, if he have
already blushed, this is a quality; for quality does not
depend on time, but consists in being such or such;
whence it follows that "having blushed" is a quality.
Therefore we shall regard as qualities only habits, and
not mere <span class="locked">dispositions;<a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a></span> being warm, for instance, and
not warming up; being sick, but not becoming sick.</p>

<h3>CONTRARINESS IS NOT THE GREATEST POSSIBLE
DIFFERENCE.</h3>

<p>20. Does every quality have an opposite?<a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> As
to vice and virtue, there is, between the extremes, an
intermediary quality which is the opposite of <span class="locked">both,<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_969" id="Page_969">969</a></span>
but, with colors, the intermediaries are not contraries.
This might be explained away on the ground that the
intermediary colors are blends of the extreme colors.
However, we ought not to have divided colors in extremes
and intermediaries, and opposed them to each
other; but rather have divided the genus of color into
black and white, and then have shown that other colors
are composed of these two, or differentiated another
color that would be intermediate, even though composite.
If it be said that intermediary colors are not
opposite to the extremes because opposition is not composed
of a simple difference, but of a maximal <span class="locked">difference,<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a></span>
it will have to be answered that this maximal
difference results from having interposed intermediaries;
if these were removed, the maximal difference
would have no scale of comparison. To the objection
that yellow approximates white more than black, and
that the sense of sight supports this contention; that
it is the same with liquids where there is no intermediary
between cold and hot; it must be answered
that white and yellow and other colors compared to
each other similarly likewise differ completely; and,
because of this their difference, constitute contrary
qualities; they are contrary, not because they have
intermediaries, but because of their characteristic
nature. Thus health and sickness are contraries,
though they have no intermediaries. Could it be said
that they are contraries because their effects differ
maximally? But how could this difference be recognized
as maximal since there are no intermediaries
which show the same characteristics at a less degree?
The difference between health and sickness could not
therefore be demonstrated to be maximal. Consequently,
oppositeness will have to be analyzed as something
else than maximal difference. Does this mean
only a great difference? Then we must in return ask
whether this "great" mean "greater by opposition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_970" id="Page_970">970</a></span>
something smaller," or "great absolutely"? In the
first case, the things which have no intermediary could
not be opposites; in the second, as it is easily granted
that there is a great difference between one nature and
another, and as we have nothing greater to serve as
measure for this distance, we shall have to examine
by what characteristics oppositeness might be recognized.</p>

<h3>CONTRARIES ARE THOSE THINGS THAT LACK
RESEMBLANCE.</h3>

<p>To begin with, resemblance does not mean only
belonging to the same genus, nor mere confusion from
more or less numerous characteristics, as, for instance,
by their forms. Things that possess resemblance,
therefore, are not opposites. Only things which have
nothing identical in respect to species are <span class="locked">opposites;<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a></span>
though we must add that they must belong to the same
genus of quality. Thus, though they have no intermediaries,
we can classify as opposites the things which
betray no resemblance to each other; in which are
found only characteristics which do not approximate
each other, and bear no kind of analogy to each other.
Consequently, objects which have something in common
in the respect of colors could not be contraries.
Besides, not everything is the contrary of every other
thing; but one thing is only the contrary of some other;
and this is the case with tastes as well as with colors.
But enough of all this.</p>

<h3>QUALITIES ADMIT OF DEGREE.</h3>

<p>Does a quality admit of more or less?<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> Evidently
the objects which participate in qualities participate
therein more or less. But the chief question is whether
there be degrees in virtue or justice? If these habits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_971" id="Page_971">971</a></span>
possess a certain latitude, they have degrees. If they
have no latitude, they are not susceptible of more or
less.</p>

<h3>REASONS WHY MOVEMENT IS A CATEGORY.</h3>

<p>21. Let us pass to <span class="locked">movement.<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a></span> Admittedly movement
is a genus with the following characteristics:
first, movement cannot be reduced to any other genus;
then, nothing higher in the scale of being can be predicated
of it; last, it reveals a great number of differences
which constitute species.</p>

<h3>MOVEMENT CANNOT BE REDUCED TO ANY HIGHER
GENUS.</h3>

<p>To what genus could (movement) be reduced? It
constitutes neither the being nor the quality of the
(being) in which it exists. It is not even reducible to
action, for in passion (or, experience) there are several
kinds of movements; and it is the actions and passions
which are reducible to movement. Further, movement
need not necessarily be a relative merely because
movement does not exist in itself, that it belongs to
some being, and that it exists in a subject; otherwise,
we should have to classify quality also as a relation;
for quality belongs to some (being) and exists in a
subject; it is not so however, with a quantity. It
might be objected that, though each of them exist in
some subject, the one by virtue of its being a quality,
and the other, of being a quantity, they themselves are
not any the less species of essences. The same argument
would apply to movement; though it belong to
some subject, it is something before belonging to a
subject, and we must consider what it is in itself. Now
what is relative is not at first something by itself, and
then the predicate of something <span class="locked">else;<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a></span> but what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_972" id="Page_972">972</a></span>
born of the relation existing between two objects, is
nothing else outside the relation to which it owes its
name; thus the double, so far as it is called doubleness,
is neither begotten, nor exists except in the comparison
established between it and a half, since, not being
conceived of before, it owes its name and its existence
to the comparison thus established.</p>

<h3>IS CHANGE ANTERIOR TO MOVEMENT?</h3>

<p>What then is movement? While belonging to a
subject, it is something by itself before belonging to a
subject, as are quality, quantity, and being. To begin
with, nothing is predicated before it, and of it, as a
genus. Is <span class="locked">change<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a></span> anterior to movement? Here
change is identical with movement, or if change is to
be considered a genus, it will form a genus to be added
to those already recognized. Besides, it is evident that,
on this hypothesis, movement will become a species,
and to it will be opposed, as another species, "generation,"
as, for instance, "generation" is a change, but
not a <span class="locked">movement.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a></span> Why then should generation not
be a movement? Is it because what is generated does
not yet exist, and because movement could not exist
in non-being? Consequently, neither will generation
be a change. Or is this so because generation is an
alteration and increase, and because it presupposes that
certain things are altered, and increase? To speak
thus is to busy ourselves with things that precede generation.
Generation presupposes production of some
other form; for generation does not consist in an
alteration passively undergone, such as being warmed,
or being whitened; such effects could be produced
before realization of the generation. What then occurs
in generation? There is alteration. Generation consists
in the production of an animal or plant, in the
reception of a form. Change is much more reasonably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_973" id="Page_973">973</a></span>
to be considered a species, than movement; because
the word change means that one thing takes the
place of another, while movement signifies the actualization
by which a being passes from what is proper
to it, to what is not, as in the translation from one
place to another. If that be not admitted (to define
movement), it will at least have to be acknowledged
that the action of studying it, as that of playing the
lyre, and in general, all the movements that modify
a habit, would be subsumed within our definition.
Alteration therefore could not be anything else but a
species of movement; since it is a movement which
produces passage from one state to <span class="locked">another.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a></span></p>

<h3>DEFINITION OF ALTERATION.</h3>

<p>22. Granting that alteration is the same thing as
movement, so far as the result of movement is to
render something other than it was, (we still have to
ask) what then is movement? To indulge in a figurative
<span class="locked">expression,<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></span> it is the passage of potentiality to the
actualization of which it is the <span class="locked">potentiality.<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a></span></p>

<h3>MOVEMENT AS A FORM OF POWER.</h3>

<p>Let us, indeed, suppose, that something which
formerly was a potentiality succeeds in assuming a
form, as "potentiality that becomes a statue," or that
passes to actualization, as a man's <span class="locked">walk.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a></span> In the case
where the metal becomes a statue, this passage is a
movement; in the case of the walking, the walk itself
is a movement, like the dance, with one who is capable
of it. In the movement of the first kind, where the
metal passes into the condition of being a statue, there
is the production of another form which is realized by
the <span class="locked">movement.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a></span> The movement of the second kind,
the dance, is a simple form of the potentiality, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_974" id="Page_974">974</a></span>
when it has ceased, leaves nothing that subsists after
<span class="locked">it.<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a></span></p>

<h3>MOVEMENT IS ACTIVE FORM, AND CAUSE OF
OTHER FORMS.</h3>

<p>We are therefore justified in calling movement "an
active form that is aroused," by opposition to the
other forms which remain inactive. (They may be
so named), whether or not they be permanent. We
may add that it is "the cause of the other forms," when
it results in producing something else. This (sense-)
movement may also be called the "life of bodies." I
say "this movement," because it bears the same name
as the movements of the intelligence, and those of
the soul.</p>

<h3>QUESTIONS ABOUT MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p>What further proves that movement is a genus, is
that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to grasp it
by a definition. But how can it be called a form when
its result is deterioration, or something passive? It
may then be compared to the warming influence of the
rays of the sun, which exerts on some things an influence
that makes them grow, while other things it
shrivels. In both cases, the movement has something
in common, and is identical, so far as it is a movement;
the difference of its results is due to the difference
of the beings in which it operates. Are then
growing sick and convalescence identical? Yes, so
far as they are movements. Is their difference then
due to their subjects, or to anything else? This question
we will consider further on, while studying alteration.
Now let us examine the elements common to
all movements; in that way we shall be able to prove
that movement is a genus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_975" id="Page_975">975</a></span></p>

<h3>COMMON ELEMENT IN GROWTH, INCREASE AND
GENERATION.</h3>

<p>First, the word "movement" can be used in different
senses, just as essence, when considered a genus.
Further, as we have already said, all the movements
by which one thing arrives at a natural state, or produces
an action suitable to its nature, constitute so
many species. Then, the movements by which one
thing arrives at a state contrary to its nature, have to
be considered as analogous to that to which they lead.</p>

<p>But what common element is there in alteration,
growth and generation, and their contraries? What is
there in common between these movements, and the
displacement in space, when you consider the four
movements, as such?<a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> The common element is that
the moved thing, after the movement, is no longer in
the former state; that it no more remains quiet, and
does not rest so long as the movement lasts. It ceaselessly
passes to another state, alters, and does not
remain what it was; for the movement would be vain
if it did not make one thing other than it was. Consequently
"otherness" does not consist in one thing becoming
other than it was, and then persisting in this
other state, but in ceaseless alteration. Thus, time
is always different from what it was because it is produced
by movement; for it is movement measured in
its march and not in its limit of motion, or stopping
point; it follows, carried away in its course. Further,
one characteristic common to all kinds of movement
is that it is the march (or process) by which potentiality
and possibility pass into actualization; for every
object in movement, whatever be the nature of this
movement, succeeds in moving only because it formerly
possessed the power of producing an action, or of experiencing
the passion of some particular nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_976" id="Page_976">976</a></span></p>

<h3>MOVEMENT FOR SENSE-OBJECTS.</h3>

<p>23. For sense-objects, which receive their impulse
from without, movement is a stimulus which agitates
them, excites them, presses them, prevents them from
slumbering in inertia, from remaining the same, and
makes them present an image of life by their agitation
and continual mutations. Besides, one must not confuse
the things that move with movement; walking is
not the feet, but an actualization of the power connected
with the feet. Now as this power is invisible,
we perceive only the agitation of the feet; we see that
their present state is quite different from that in
which they would have been, had they remained in
place, and that they have some addition, which however,
is invisible. Thus, being united to objects other
than itself, the power is perceived only accidentally,
because one notices that the feet change place, and
do not rest. Likewise, alteration in the altered object,
is recognized only by failure to discover in it the same
quality as before.</p>

<h3>MOVEMENT AS INFLUX.</h3>

<p>What is the seat of a movement acting on an object
by passing from internal power to actualization? Is
it in the motor? How will that which is moved and
which suffers be able to receive it? Is it in the
movable element? Why does it not remain in the
mover? Movement must therefore be considered as
inseparable from the mover, although not exclusively;
it must pass from the mover into the mobile (element)
without ceasing to be connected with the mover, and
it must pass from the mover to the moved like a breath
(or influx).<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> When the motive power produces locomotion,
it gives us an impulse and makes us change
place ceaselessly; when it is calorific, it heats; when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_977" id="Page_977">977</a></span>
meeting matter, it imparts thereto its natural organization,
and produces increase; when it removes something
from an object, this object decreases because it
is capable thereof; last, when it is the generative power
which enters into action, generation occurs; but if this
generative power be weaker than the destructive
power, there occurs destruction, not of what is already
produced, but of what was in the process of production.
Likewise, convalescence takes place as soon as the
force capable of producing health acts and dominates;
and sickness occurs, when the opposite power produces
a contrary effect. Consequently, movement must be
studied not only in the things in which it is produced,
but also in those that produce it or transmit it. The
property of movement consists therefore in being a
movement endowed with some particular quality, or
being something definite in a particular thing.</p>

<h3>MOVEMENT OF DISPLACEMENT IS SINGLE.</h3>

<p>24. As to movement of displacement, we may ask
if ascending be the opposite of descending, in what the
circular movement differs from the rectilinear movement,
what difference obtains in throwing an object at
the head or at the feet. The difference is not very
clear, for in these cases the motive power is the same.
Shall we say that there is one power which causes
raising, and another that lowers, especially if these
movements be natural, and if they be the result of
lightness or heaviness? In both cases, there is something
in common, namely, direction towards its natural
place, so that the difference is derived from exterior
circumstances. Indeed, in circular and rectilinear
movement, if someone move the same object in turn
circularly and in a straight line, what difference is there
in the motive power? The difference could be derived
only from the figure (or outward appearance) of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_978" id="Page_978">978</a></span>
movement, unless it should be said that the circular
movement is composite, that it is not a veritable movement,
and that it does not produce any change by
itself. In all of these cases, the movement of displacement
is identical, and presents only adventitious
differences.</p>

<h3>EXPLANATION OF COMPOSITION AND DECOMPOSITION.</h3>

<p>25. Of what do composition (blending, or mixture)
and decomposition consist? Do they constitute
other kinds of movement than those already noticed,
generation and destruction, growth and decrease,
movement of displacement and alteration? Shall
composition and decomposition be reduced to some
one of these kinds of motion, or shall we look at this
process inversely? If composition consist in approximating
one thing to another, and in joining them together;
and if, on the other hand, decomposition consist
in separating the things which were joined, we
have here only two movements of displacement, a
uniting, and a separating one. We should be able to
reduce composition and decomposition to one of the
above recognized kinds of motion, if we were to acknowledge
that this composition was <span class="locked">mingling,<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a></span> combination,
fusion, and union&mdash;a union which consists in
two things uniting, and not in being already united.
Indeed, composition includes first the movement of
displacement, and then an alteration; just as, in increase,
there was first the movement of displacement,
and then movement in the kind of the <span class="locked">quality.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a></span> Likewise,
here there is first the movement of displacement,
then the composition or decomposition, according as
things approximate or <span class="locked">separate.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a></span> Often also decomposition
is accompanied or followed by a movement
of displacement, but the things which separate undergo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_979" id="Page_979">979</a></span>
a modification different from the movement of displacement;
similarly, composition is a modification
which follows the movement of displacement, but
which has a different nature.</p>

<h3>COMPOSITION AND DECOMPOSITION ARE NOT
ALTERATIONS.</h3>

<p>Shall we have to admit that composition and decomposition
are movements which exist by themselves,
and analyze alteration into them? Condensation is
explained as undergoing an alteration; that means, as
becoming composite. On the other hand, rarefaction
is also explained as undergoing an alteration, namely,
that of decomposition; when, for instance, one mingles
water and wine, each of these two things becomes other
than it was, and it is the composition which has operated
the alteration. We will answer that here composition
and decomposition no doubt precede certain
alterations, but these alterations are something different
than compositions and decompositions. Other
alterations (certainly) are not compositions and decompositions,
for neither can condensation nor rarefaction
be reduced to these movements, nor are they composed
of them. Otherwise, it would be necessary to
acknowledge the (existence of) emptiness. Besides,
how could you explain blackness and whiteness, as
being composed of composition and decomposition?
This doctrine would destroy all colors and qualities,
or at least, the greater part of them; for if all alteration,
that means, all change of quality, consisted in a
composition or decomposition, the result would not
be the production of a quality, but an aggregation or
disaggregation. How indeed could you explain the
movements of teaching and studying by mere "composition"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_980" id="Page_980">980</a></span></p>

<h3>MOVEMENTS DIVIDED IN NATURAL, ARTIFICIAL,
AND VOLUNTARY.</h3>

<p>26. Let us now examine the different kinds of
movements. Shall we classify movements of displacement
in movements upwards and downwards, rectilinear
or curvilinear, or in movements of animate and
inanimate beings? There is indeed a difference between
the movement of inanimate beings, and that of
animate beings; and these latter have different kinds
of motion, such as walking, flying, and swimming.
Their movements could also be analyzed in two other
ways, according as it was conformable to, or against
their nature; but this would not explain the outer differences
of movements. Perhaps the movements
themselves produce these differences, and do not exist
without them; nevertheless, it is nature that seems to
be the principle of the movements, and of their exterior
differences. It would further be possible to
classify movements as natural, artificial, and voluntary;
of the natural, there are alteration and destruction;
of the artificial, there are the building of houses, and
construction of vessels; of the voluntary, there are
meditation, learning, devoting oneself to political occupations,
and, in general, speaking and acting. Last,
we might, in growth, alteration and generation, distinguish
the natural movement, and that contrary to
nature; or even establish a classification founded on
the nature of the subjects in which these movements
occur.</p>

<h3>DISTINCTION BETWEEN STABILITY AND STILLNESS.</h3>

<p>27. Let us now study stability or stillness, which is
the contrary of <span class="locked">movement.<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a></span> Are we to consider it
itself a genus, or to reduce it to some one of the known
genera? First, stability rather suits the intelligible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_981" id="Page_981">981</a></span>
world, and stillness the sense-world. Let us now
examine stillness. If it be identical with stability, it is
useless to look for it here below where nothing is
stable, and where apparent stability is in reality only
a slower movement. If stillness be different from
stability, because the latter refers to what is completely
immovable, and stillness to what is actually fixed, but
is naturally movable even when it does not actually
move, the following distinction should be established.
If stillness here below be considered, this rest is a
movement which has not yet ceased, but which is
imminent; if by stillness is understood the complete
cessation of movement in the moved, it will be necessary
to examine whether there be anything here below
that is absolutely without movement. As it is impossible
for one thing to possess simultaneously all the
species of movement, and as there are necessarily
movements that are not realized in it&mdash;since it is usual
to say that some particular movement is in something&mdash;when
something undergoes no displacement, and
seems still in respect to this movement, should one not
say about it that in this respect it is not moving?
Stillness is therefore the negation of movement. Now
no negation constitutes a genus. The thing we are
considering is at rest only in respect to local movement;
stillness expresses therefore only the negation
of this movement.</p>

<h3>MOVEMENT IS MORE THAN THE NEGATION OF
REST.</h3>

<p>It may perhaps be asked, why is movement not
rather the negation of rest? We shall then answer
that movement (is something positive), that it brings
something with it; that it has some efficiency, that it
communicates an impulsion to the subject, that produces
or destroys many things; stillness, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_982" id="Page_982">982</a></span>
is nothing outside of the subject which is still,
and means no more than that the latter is still.</p>

<h3>IN THE INTELLIGIBLE STABILITY DOES NOT IMPLY
STILLNESS.</h3>

<p>But why should we not regard the stability of intelligible
things also as a negation of movement?
Because stability is not the privation of movement; it
does not begin to exist when movement ceases, and
it does not hinder it from simultaneous existence with
it. In intelligible being, stability does not imply the
cessation of movement of that whose nature it is to
<span class="locked">move.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a></span> On the contrary, so far as intelligible being is
contained in (or, expressed by) stability, it is stable;
so far as it moves, it will ever move; it is therefore
stable by stability, and movable by movement. The
body, however, is no doubt moved by movement, but
it rests only in the absence of movement, when it is
deprived of the movement that it ought to have. Besides,
what would stability be supposed to imply (if
it were supposed to exist in sense-objects)? When
somebody passes from sickness to health, he enters on
convalescence. What kind of stillness shall we oppose
to convalescence? Shall we oppose to it that condition
from which that man had just issued? That
state was sickness, and not stability. Shall we oppose
to it the state in which that man has just entered?
That state is health, which is not identical with stability.
To say that sickness and health are each of
them a sort of stability, is to consider sickness and
health as species of stability, which is absurd. Further,
if it were said that stability is an accident of health, it
would result that before stability health would not be
health. As to such arguments, let each reason according
to his fancy!</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION OF THE STUDY.</h3>

<p>28. We have demonstrated that acting and experiencing
were movements; that, among the movements,
some are absolute, while others constitute
actions or <span class="locked">passions.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a></span></p>

<p>We have also demonstrated that the other things
that are called genera must be reduced to the genera
we have set <span class="locked">forth.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a></span></p>

<p>We have also studied relation, defining it as a habit,
a "manner of being" of one thing in respect of another,
which results from the co-operation of two things; we
have explained that, when a habit of being constitutes
a reference, this thing is something relative, not so
much as it is being, but as far as it is a part of this
being, as are the hand, the head, the cause, the principle,
or the <span class="locked">element.<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a></span> The relatives might be
divided according to the scheme of the ancient (philosophers),
by saying that some of them are efficient
causes, while others are measures, that the former distinguish
themselves by their resemblances and differences,
while the latter consist in excess or in lack.</p>

<p>Such are our views about the (categories, or) genera
(of existence).</p>

<h3 class="large">A. ETERNITY.</h3>

<h3>INTRODUCTION. ETERNITY EXISTS PERPETUALLY,
WHILE TIME BECOMES.</h3>

<p>(1.)<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> When saying that eternity and time differ,
that eternity refers to perpetual existence, and time to
what "becomes" (this visible world), we are speaking
off-hand, spontaneously, intuitionally, and common
language supports these forms of expression. When
however we try to define our conceptions thereof in
greater detail, we become embarrassed; the different
opinions of ancient philosophers, and often even the
same opinions, are interpreted differently. We however
shall limit ourselves to an examination of these
opinions, and we believe that we can fulfil our task of
answering all questions by explaining the teachings
of the ancient philosophers, without starting any
minute disquisition of our own. We do indeed insist
that some of these ancient philosophers, these blessed
<span class="locked">men<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a></span> have achieved the truth. It remains only to
decide which of them have done so, and how we ourselves
can grasp their thought.</p>

<h3>ETERNITY IS THE MODEL OF ITS IMAGE, TIME.</h3>

<p>First, we have to examine that of which eternity
consists, according to those who consider it as different
from time; for, by gaining a conception of the model<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_986" id="Page_986">986</a></span>
(eternity), we shall more clearly understand its image
called <span class="locked">time.<a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a></span> If then, before observing eternity, we
form a conception of time, we may, by reminiscence,
from here below, rise to the contemplation of the
model to which time, as its image, resembles.</p>

<h3>RELATION BETWEEN THE AEON AND
INTELLIGIBLE BEING.</h3>

<p>1. (2). How shall we define the aeon (or, eternity)?
Shall we say that it is the intelligible "being"
(or, nature) itself, just as we might say that time is
the heaven and the universe, as has been done, it
seems, by certain (Pythagorean) philosophers?<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> Indeed,
as we conceive and judge that the aeon (eternity)
is something very venerable, we assert the same
of intelligible "being," and yet it is not easy to decide
which of the two should occupy the first rank; as, on
the other hand, the principle which is superior to them
(the One) could not be thus described, it would seem
that we would have the right to identify intelligible
"being" (or, nature), and the aeon (or, eternity),
so much the more as the intelligible world and the aeon
(age, or eternity), comprise the same things. Nevertheless,
were we to place one of these principles within the
other, we would posit intelligible nature ("being")
within the aeon (age, or eternity). Likewise, when we
say that an intelligible entity is eternal, as (Plato)
<span class="locked">does:<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></span> "the nature of the model is eternal," we are
thereby implying that the aeon (age or eternity) is
something distinct from intelligible nature ("being"),
though referring thereto, as attribute or presence. The
mere fact that both the aeon (eternity) and intelligible
nature ("being"), are both venerable does not imply
their identity; the venerableness of the one may be
no more than derivative from that of the other. The
argument that both comprise the same entities would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_987" id="Page_987">987</a></span>
still permit intelligible nature ("being") to contain
all the entities it contains as parts, while the aeon (or
age, or eternity) might contain them as wholes, without
any distinctions as parts; it contains them, in this
respect, that they are called eternal on its account.</p>

<h3>FAULTS OF THE DEFINITION THAT ETERNITY IS AT
REST, WHILE TIME IS IN MOTION.</h3>

<p>Some define eternity as the <span class="locked">"rest"<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a></span> of intelligible
nature ("being"), just like time is defined as "motion"
here below. In this case we should have to decide
whether eternity be identical with rest in general, or
only in such rest as would be characteristic of intelligible
nature ("being"). If indeed eternity were to
be identified with rest in general, we would first have
to observe that rest could not be said to be eternal,
any more than we can say that eternity is eternal, for
we only call eternal that which participates in eternity;
further, under this hypothesis, we should have to clear
up how movement could ever be eternal; for if it were
eternal, it would rest (or, it would stop). Besides,
how could the idea of rest thus imply the idea of perpetuity,
not indeed of that perpetuity which is in time,
but of that of which we conceive when speaking of
the aeonial (or, eternal)? Besides, if the rest characteristic
of intelligible "being" in itself alone contain
perpetuity, this alone would exclude from eternity the
other genera (or categories) of existence. Further
yet, eternity has to be conceived of as not only in
rest, but (according to <span class="locked">Plato<a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a></span>) also in unity, which is
something that excludes every interval&mdash;otherwise, it
would become confused with time;&mdash;now rest does
not imply the idea of unity, nor that of an interval.
Again, we assert that eternity resides in unity; and
therefore participates in rest without being identified
therewith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_988" id="Page_988">988</a></span></p>

<h3>ETERNITY AS A UNION OF THE FIVE CATEGORIES.</h3>

<p>2. (3). What then is that thing by virtue of which
the intelligible world is eternal and perpetual? Of
what does perpetuity consist? Either perpetuity and
eternity are identical, or eternity is related to perpetuity.
Evidently, however, eternity consists in an unity,
but in an unity formed by multiple elements, in a conception
of nature derived from intelligible entities, or
which is united to them, or is perceived in them, so
that all these intelligible entities form an unity, though
this unity be at the same time manifold in nature and
powers. Thus contemplating the manifold power of
the intelligible world, we call "being" its substrate;
movement its life; rest its permanence; difference the
manifoldness of its principles; and identity, their
<span class="locked">unity.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a></span> Synthesizing these principles, they fuse into
one single life, suppressing their difference, considering
the inexhaustible duration, the identity and immutability
of their action, of their life and thought, for
which there is neither change nor interval. The contemplation
of all these entities constitutes the contemplation
of eternity; and we see a life that is permanent
in its identity, which ever possesses all present things,
which does not contain them successively, but simultaneously;
whose manner of existence is not different
at various times, but whose perfection is consummate
and indivisible. It therefore contains all things at the
same time, as in a single point, without any of them
draining off; it resides in identity, that is, within itself,
undergoing no change. Ever being in the present,
because it never lost anything, and will never acquire
anything, it is always what it is. Eternity is not intelligible
existence; it is the (light) that radiates from
this existence, whose identity completely excludes the
future and admits nothing but present existence, which
remains what it is, and does not change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_989" id="Page_989">989</a></span></p>

<h3>THE LIFE OF THE INTELLIGENCE IS EVER
CONTEMPORANEOUS.</h3>

<p>What that it does not already possess could (intelligible
existence) possess later? What could it be in
the future, that it is not now? There is nothing that
could be added to or subtracted from its present state;
for it was not different from what it is now; and it is
not to possess anything that it does not necessarily
possess now, so that one could never say of it, "it was";
for what did it have that it does not now have? Nor
could it be said of it, "it will be"; for what could it
acquire? It must therefore remain what it is. (As
Plato <span class="locked">thought<a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a></span>), that possesses eternity of which one
cannot say either "it was," or "will be," but only, "it
is;" that whose existence is immutable, because the
past did not make it lose anything, and because the
future will not make it acquire anything. Therefore,
on examining the existence of intelligible nature, we
see that its life is simultaneously entire, complete, and
without any kind of an interval. That is the eternity
we seek.</p>

<h3>ETERNITY IS NOT AN ACCIDENT OF THE INTELLIGIBLE,
BUT AN INTIMATE PART OF ITS
NATURE.</h3>

<p>3. (4). Eternity is not an extrinsic accident of
(intelligible) nature, but is in it, of it, and with it. We
see that it is intimately inherent in (intelligible nature)
because we see that all other things, of which we say
that they exist on high, are of and with this (intelligible)
nature; for the things that occupy the first
rank in existence must be united with the first Beings,
and subsist there. Thus the beautiful is in them, and
comes from them; thus also does truth dwell in them.
There the whole in a certain way exists within the
part; the parts also are in the whole; because this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_990" id="Page_990">990</a></span>
whole, really being the whole, is not composed of
parts, but begets the parts themselves, a condition
necessary to its being a whole. In this whole, besides,
truth does not consist in the agreement of one notion
with another, but is the very nature of each of the
things of which it is the truth. In order, really to be a
whole, this real whole must be all not only in the sense
that it is all things, but also in the sense that it lacks
nothing. In this case, nothing will, for it, be in the
future; for to say that, for it, something "will be" for
it implies that it lacked something before that, that it
was not yet all; besides, nothing can happen to it
against nature, because it is impassible. As nothing
could happen to it, for it nothing "is to be," "will be,"
or "has been."</p>

<h3>TO BEGOTTEN THINGS THE FUTURE IS NECESSARY;
BUT NOT TO THE INTELLIGIBLE.</h3>

<p>As the existence of begotten things consists in perpetually
acquiring (something or another), they will
be annihilated by a removal of their future. An attribution
of the future to the (intelligible) entities of
a nature contrary (to begotten things), would degrade
them from the rank of existences. Evidently they will
not be consubstantial with existence, if this existence of
theirs be in the future or past. The nature ("being")
of begotten things on the contrary consists in going
from the origin of their existence to the last limits of
the time beyond which they will no longer exist; that
is in what their future <span class="locked">consists.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a></span> Abstraction of their
future diminishes their life, and consequently their
existence. That is also what will happen to the universe,
in so far as it will exist; it aspires to being what
it should be, without any interruption, because it derives
existence from the continual production of fresh
actualizations; for the same reason, it moves in a circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_991" id="Page_991">991</a></span>
because it desires to possess intelligible nature
("being"). Such is the existence that we discover in
begotten things, such is the cause that makes them
ceaselessly aspire to existence in the future. The
Beings that occupy the first rank and which are
blessed, have no desire of the future, because they are
already all that it lies in them to be, and because they
possess all the life they are ever to possess. They have
therefore nothing to seek, since there is no future for
them; neither can they receive within themselves anything
for which there might be a future. Thus the
nature ("being") of intelligible existence is absolute,
and entire, not only in its parts, but also in its totality,
which reveals no fault, which lacks nothing, and to
which nothing that in any way pertains to nonentity
could be added; for intelligible existence must not only
embrace in its totality and universality all beings, but
it must also receive nothing that pertains to nonentity.
It is this disposition and nature of intelligible existence
that constitutes the aeon (or eternity); for (according
to Aristotle)<a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> this word is derived from "aei on,"
"being continually."</p>

<h3>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ETERNITY AND
PERPETUITY.</h3>

<p>4. (5). That this is the state of affairs appears
when, on applying one's intelligence to the contemplation
of some of the intelligible Entities, it becomes possible
to assert, or rather, to see that it is absolutely incapable
of ever having undergone any change; otherwise,
it would not always exist; or rather, it would
not always exist entirely. Is it thus perpetual? Doubtless;
its nature is such that one may recognize that it
is always such as it is, and that it could never be different
in the future; so that, should one later on again
contemplate it, it will be found similar to itself (unchanged).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_992" id="Page_992">992</a></span>
Therefore, if we should never cease from
contemplation, if we should ever remain united thereto
while admiring its nature, and if in that actualization
we should show ourselves indefatigable, we would succeed
in raising ourselves to eternity; but, to be as
eternal as existence, we must not allow ourselves to
be in anyway distracted from contemplating eternity,
and eternal nature in the eternal itself. If that which
exists thus be eternal, and exists ever, evidently that
which never lowers itself to an inferior nature; which
possesses life in its fulness, without ever having received,
receiving, or being about to receive anything;
this nature would be "aidion," or perpetual. Perpetuity
is the property constitutive of such a substrate;
being of it, and in <span class="locked">it.<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a></span> Eternity is the substrate in
which this property manifests. Consequently reason
dictates that eternity is something venerable, identical
with the <span class="locked">divinity.<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a></span> We might even assert that the age
("aion," or eternity) is a divinity that manifests within
itself, and outside of itself in its immutable and identical
existence, in the permanence of its life. Besides,
there is nothing to surprise any one if in spite of that
we assert a manifoldness in the divinity. Every intelligible
entity is manifoldness because infinite in
power, infinite in the sense that it lacks nothing; it
exercises this privilege peculiarly because it is not subject
to losing anything.</p>

<h3>ETERNITY IS INFINITE UNIVERSAL LIFE THAT
CANNOT LOSE ANYTHING.</h3>

<p>Eternity, therefore, may be defined as the life that
is at present infinite because it is universal and loses
nothing, as it has no past nor future; otherwise it
would no longer be whole. To say that it is universal
and loses nothing explains the expression: "the life
that is at present infinite."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_993" id="Page_993">993</a></span></p>

<h3>ETERNITY IS SEMPITERNAL EXISTENCE.</h3>

<p>5. (6). As this nature that is eternal and radiant
with beauty refers to the One, issues from Him, and
returns to Him, as it never swerves from Him, ever
dwelling around Him and in Him, and lives according
to Him, Plato was quite <span class="locked">right<a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a></span> in saying not casually,
but with great profundity of thought, that "eternity is
immutable in unity." Thereby Plato not only reduces
the eternity to the unity that it is in itself, but also
relates the life of existence to the One itself. This life
is what we seek; its permanence is eternity. Indeed
that which remains in that manner, and which remains
the same thing, that is, the actualization of that life
which remains turned towards, and united with the
One, that whose existence and life are not deceptive,
that truly is eternity. (For intelligible or) true existence
is to have no time when it does not exist, no time
when it exists in a different manner; it is therefore to
exist in an immutable manner without any diversity,
without being first in one, and then in another state.
To conceive of (existence), therefore, we must neither
imagine intervals in its existence, nor suppose that it
develops or acquires, nor believe that it contains any
succession; consequently we could neither distinguish
within it, or assert within it either before or after.
If it contain neither "before" nor "after," if the truest
thing that can be affirmed of it be that it is, if it exist
as "being" and life, here again is eternity revealed.
When we say that existence exists always, and that
there is not one time in which it is, and another in
which it is not, we speak thus only for the sake of
greater clearness; for when we use the word "always,"
we do not take it in an absolute sense; but if we use
it to show that existence is incorruptible, it might well
mislead the mind in leading it to issue out from the
unity (characteristic of eternity) to make it run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_994" id="Page_994">994</a></span>
through the manifold (which is foreign to eternity).
"Always" further indicates that existence is never defective.
It might perhaps be better to say simply "existence."
But though the word "existence" suffices
to designate "being," as several philosophers have
confused "being" with generation, it was necessary to
clear up the meaning of existence by adding the term
"always." Indeed, though we are referring only to
one and the same thing by "existence" and "existing
always," just as when we say "philosopher," and "the
true philosopher," nevertheless, as there are false
philosophers, it has been necessary to add to the term
"philosophers" the adjective "true." Likewise, it has
been necessary to add the term "always" to that of
"existing," and that of "existing" to that of "always;"
that is the derivation of the expression "existing
always," and consequently (by contraction), "aion,"
or, eternity. Therefore the idea "always" must be
united to that of "existing," so as to designate the
"real being."</p>

<h3>THE CREATOR, BEING OUTSIDE OF TIME, PRECEDES
THE UNIVERSAL ONLY AS ITS CAUSE.</h3>

<p>"Always" must therefore be applied to the power
which contains no interval in its existence, which has
need of nothing outside of what it possesses, because
it possesses everything, because it is every being, and
thus lacks nothing. Such a nature could not be complete
in one respect, but incomplete in another. Even
if what is in time should appear complete, as a body
that suffices the soul appears complete, though it be
complete only for the soul; that which is in time
needs the future, and consequently is incomplete in
respect to the time it stands in need of; when it succeeds
in enjoying the time to which it aspires, and
succeeds in becoming united thereto, even though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_995" id="Page_995">995</a></span>
still remain imperfect it still is called perfect by verbal
similarity. But the existence whose characteristic it is
not to need the future, not to be related to any other
time&mdash;whether capable of being measured, or indefinite,
and still to be indefinite&mdash;the existence that
already possesses all it should possess is the very existence
that our intelligence seeks out; it does not derive
its existence from any particular quality, but exists
before any quantity. As it is not any kind of quantity,
it could not admit within itself any kind of quantity.
Otherwise, as its life would be divided, it would itself
cease to be absolutely indivisible; but existence must
be as indivisible in its life as in its nature ("being").
(Plato's <span class="locked">expression,<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a></span>) "the Creator was good" does
indeed refer to the notion of the universe, and indicates
that, in the Principle superior to the universe, nothing
began to exist at any particular time. Never, therefore,
did the universe begin to exist within time, because
though its Author existed "before" it, it was only
in the sense that its author was the cause of its existence.
But, after having used the word "was," to express
this thought, Plato immediately corrects himself,
and he demonstrates that this word does not apply to
the Things that possess eternity.</p>

<h3>TO STUDY TIME WE HAVE TO DESCEND FROM THE
INTELLIGIBLE WORLD.</h3>

<p>6. (7). Speaking thus of eternity, it is not anything
foreign to us, and we do not need to consult the
testimony of anybody but ourselves. For indeed, how
could we understand anything that we could not perceive?
How could we perceive something that would
be foreign to us? We ourselves, therefore, must participate
in eternity. But how can we do so, since we
are in time? To understand how one can simultaneously
be in time and in eternity, it will be necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_996" id="Page_996">996</a></span>
study time. We must therefore descend from eternity
to study time. To find eternity, we have been obliged
to rise to the intelligible world; now we are obliged to
descend therefrom to treat of time; not indeed descending
therefrom entirely, but only so far as time
itself descended therefrom.</p>

<h3 class="large">B. TIME.</h3>

<h3>THE OPINIONS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS ABOUT
TIME MUST BE STUDIED.</h3>

<p>If those blessed ancient philosophers had not already
uttered their views about time, we would only need to
add to the idea of eternity what we have to say of the
idea of time, and to set forth our opinion on the subject,
trying to make it correspond with the already
expressed notion of eternity. But we now must examine
the most reasonable opinions that have been
advanced about time, and observe how far our own
opinion may conform thereto.</p>

<h3>TIME CONSIDERED EITHER AS MOTION; AS SOMETHING
MOVABLE; OR SOMETHING OF MOTION.</h3>

<p>To begin with, we may divide the generally accepted
opinions about time into three classes: time as movement,
as something movable, or as some part of movement.
It would be too contrary to the notion of time
to try to define it as rest, as being at rest, or as some
part of rest; for time is incompatible with identity
(and consequently with rest, and with what is at rest).
Those who consider time as movement, claim that it
is either any kind of movement, or the movement of
the universe. Those who consider it as something
movable are thinking of the sphere of the universe;
while those who consider time as some part of movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_997" id="Page_997">997</a></span>
consider it either as the interval of movement, or
as its measure, or as some consequence of movement
in general, or regular movement.</p>

<h3>POLEMIC AGAINST THE STOICS; TIME IS NOT
MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p>7. (8). Time cannot (as the Stoics <span class="locked">claim,<a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a></span>) be
movement. Neither can we gather together all movements,
so as to form but a single one, nor can we consider
the regular movement only; for these two kinds
of motion are within time. If we were to suppose that
there was a movement that did not operate within
time, such a movement would still be far removed
from being time, since, under this hypothesis, the
movement itself is entirely different from that in which
the movement occurs. Amidst the many reasons
which, in past and present, have been advanced to
refute this opinion, a single one suffices: namely, that
movement can cease and stop, while time never suspends
its flight. To the objection that the movement
of the universe never stops, we may answer that this
movement, if it consist in the circular movement (of
the stars, according to Hestius of Perinthus; or of the
sun, according to <span class="locked">Eratosthenes<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a></span>) operates within a
definite time, at the end of which it returns to the
same point of the heavens, but it does not accomplish
this within the same space of time taken up in fulfilling
the half of its course. One of these movements is
only half of the other, and the second is double. Besides,
both, the one that runs through half of space,
and the one that runs through the whole of it, are
movements of the universe. Besides, it has been
noticed that the movement of the exterior sphere is
the swiftest. This distinction supports our view, for
it implies that the movement of this sphere, and the
time used to operate it, are different entities; the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_998" id="Page_998">998</a></span>
rapid movement is the one that takes up the least
time, and runs through the greatest amount of space;
the slowest movements are those that employ the
longest time, and run through only a part of that
<span class="locked">space.<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a></span></p>

<h3>POLEMIC AGAINST THE PYTHAGOREANS: TIME IS
NOT WHAT IS MOVABLE.</h3>

<p>On the other hand, if time be not the movement of
the sphere, evidently it is far less (than that which is
movable, as thought the <span class="locked">Pythagoreans,<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></span>) or (as
Pythagoras thought), the sphere (of heaven) itself,
as some have thought, because it moves. (This fact
alone is sufficient to refute the opinion that confuses
time with that which is movable).</p>

<h3>POLEMIC AGAINST THE STOIC ZENO: TIME IS NO
INTERVAL OF MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p>Is time then some part of movement? (Zeno<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a>)
calls it the interval of movement; but the interval is
not the same for all movements, even if the latter
were of similar nature; for movements that operate
within space may be swifter or slower. It is possible
that the intervals of the most rapid and of the slowest
movement might be measured by some third interval,
which might far more reasonably be considered time.
But which of these three intervals shall be called time?
Rather, which of all the intervals, infinite in number as
they are, shall time be? If time be considered the
interval of the regular movement, it will not be the
particular interval of every regular movement; otherwise,
as there are several regular movements, there
would be several kinds of time. If time be defined as
the interval of movement of the universe, that is, the
interval contained within this movement, it will be
nothing else than this movement itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_999" id="Page_999">999</a></span></p>

<h3>PERSISTENT MOVEMENT AND ITS INTERVAL ARE
NOT TIME, BUT ARE WITHIN IT.</h3>

<p>Besides, this movement is a definite quantity. Either
this quantity will be measured by the extension of the
space traversed, and the interval will consist in that
extension; but that extension is space, and not time.
Or we shall say that movement has a certain interval
because it is continuous, and that instead of stopping
immediately it always becomes prolonged; but this
continuity is nothing else than the magnitude (that is,
the duration) of the movement. Even though after
consideration of a movement it be estimated as great,
as might be said of a "great heat"&mdash;this does not yet
furnish anything in which time might appear and manifest;
we have here only a sequence of movements
which succeed one another like waves, and only the
observed interval between them; now the sequence of
movements forms a number, such as two or three;
and the interval is an extension. Thus the magnitude
of the movement will be a number, say, such as ten;
or an interval that manifests in the extension traversed
by the movement. Now the notion of time is not
revealed herein, but we find only a quantity that is
produced within time. Otherwise, time, instead of
being everywhere, will exist only in the movement as
an attribute in a substrate, which amounts to saying
that time is movement; for the interval (of the movement)
is not outside of movement, and is only a non-instantaneous
movement. If then time be a non-instantaneous
movement, just as we often say that
some particular instantaneous fact occurs within time,
we shall be forced to ask the difference between what
is and what is not instantaneous. Do these things
differ in relation to time? Then the persisting movement
and its interval are not time, but within time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1000" id="Page_1000">1000</a></span></p>

<h3>POLEMIC AGAINST STRATO: TIME IS NOT MOTION
AND REST.</h3>

<p>Somebody might object that time is indeed the interval
of movement, but that it is not the characteristic
interval of movement itself, being only the interval in
which movement exerts its extension, following along
with it. All these terms lack definition. This (extension)
is nothing else than the time within which the
movement occurs. But that is precisely the question
at issue, from the very start. It is as if a person who
had been asked to define time should answer "time is
the interval of the movement produced within time."
What then is this interval called time, when considered
outside of the interval characteristic of movement?
If the interval characteristic of time be made to consist
in movement, where shall the duration of rest be
posited? Indeed, for one object to be in motion implies
that another (corresponding object) is at rest;
now the time of these objects is the same, though for
one it be the time of movement, and for the other the
time of rest (as thought <span class="locked">Strato<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a></span>). What then is the
nature of this interval? It cannot be an interval of
space, since space is exterior (to the movements that
occur within it).</p>

<h3>POLEMIC AGAINST ARISTOTLE: TIME IS NOT THE
NUMBER AND MEASURE OF MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p>8. (9). Let us now examine in what sense it may
be said (by <span class="locked">Aristotle<a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a></span>) that time is the number and
measure of movement, which definition seems more
reasonable, because of the continuity of movement.
To begin with, following the method adopted with the
definition of time as "the interval of movement," we
might ask whether time be the measure and number of
any kind of <span class="locked">movement.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a></span> For how indeed could we
give a numerical valuation of unequal or irregular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1001" id="Page_1001">1001</a></span>
movement. What system of numbering or measurement
shall we use for this? If the same measure be
applied to slow or to swift movement, in their case
measure and number will be the same as the number
ten applied equally to horses and oxen; and further,
such measure might also be applied to dry and wet
substances. If time be a measure of this kind, we
clearly see that it is the measure of movements, but
we do not discover what it may be in itself. If the
number ten can be conceived as a number, after making
abstraction of the horses it served to measure, if therefore
a measure possess its own individuality, even
while no longer measuring anything, the case must be
similar with time, inasmuch as it is a measure. If then
time be a number in itself, in what does it differ from
the number ten, or from any other number composed of
unities? As it is a continuous measure, and as it is a
quantity, it might, for instance, turn out to be something
like a foot-rule. It would then be a magnitude,
as, for instance, a line, which follows the movement;
but how will this line be able to measure what it
follows? Why would it measure one thing rather than
another? It seems more reasonable to consider this
measure, not as the measure of every kind of movement,
but only as the measure of the movement it
<span class="locked">follows.<a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a></span> Then that measure is continuous, so far
as the movement it follows itself continue to exist. In
this case, we should not consider measure as something
exterior, and separated from movement, but as united
to the measured movement. What then will measure?
Is it the movement that will be measured, and the
extension that will measure it? Which of these two
things will time be? Will it be the measuring movement,
or the measuring extension? Time will be
either the movement measured by extension, or
the measuring extension; or some third thing which
makes use of extension, as one makes use of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1002" id="Page_1002">1002</a></span>
foot-rule, to measure the quantity of movement. But
in all these cases, we must, as has already been noticed,
suppose that movement is uniform; for unless the
movement be uniform, one and universal, the theory
that movement is a measure of any kind whatever will
become almost impossible. If time be "measured
movement," that is, measured by quantity&mdash;besides
granting that it at all needs to be measured&mdash;movement
must not be measured by itself, but by something
different. On the other hand, if movement have a
measure different from itself, and if, consequently, we
need a continuous measure to measure it, the result
would be that extension itself would need measure, so
that movement, being measured, may have a quantity
which is determined by that of the thing according to
which it is measured. Consequently, under this hypothesis,
time would be the number of the extension
which follows movement, and not extension itself
which follows movement.</p>

<h3>NOR CAN TIME BE A NUMBERED NUMBER (AS
ARISTOTLE <span class="locked">CLAIMED<a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a></span>).</h3>

<p>What is this number? Is it composed of unities?
How does it measure? That would still have to be
explained. Now let us suppose that we had discovered
how it measures; we would still not have discovered
the time that measures, but a time that was such or
such an amount. Now that is not the same thing as
time; there is a difference between time and some
particular quantity of time. Before asserting that time
has such or such a quantity, we have to discover the
nature of that which has that quantity. We may grant
that time is the number which measures movement,
while remaining exterior thereto, as "ten" is in "ten
horses" without being conceived with them (as Aristotle
claimed, that it was not a numbering, but a numbered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1003" id="Page_1003">1003</a></span>
number). But in this case, we still have to discover
the nature of this number that, before numbering, is
what it is, as would be "ten" considered in <span class="locked">itself.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a></span>
It may be said that it is that number which, by following
number, measures according to the priority and
posteriority of that <span class="locked">movement.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a></span> Nor do we yet
perceive the nature of that number which measures
by priority and posteriority. In any case, whatever
measures by priority or posteriority, or by a present
<span class="locked">moment,<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a></span> or by anything else, certainly does measure
according to time. Thus this number (?) which
measures movement according to priority or posteriority,
must touch time, and, to measure movement, be
related thereto. Prior and posterior necessarily designate
either different parts of space, as for instance the
beginning of a stadium, or parts of time. What is
called priority is time that ends with the present; what
is called posteriority, is the time that begins at the
present. Time therefore is something different from
the number that measures movement according to priority
or posteriority,&mdash;I do not say, any kind of movement,
but still regular movement. Besides, why should
we have time by applying number either to what
measures, or to what is measured? For in this case
these two may be identical. If movement exist along
with the priority and posteriority which relate thereto,
why will we not have time without number? This
would amount to saying that extension has such a quantity
only in case of the existence of somebody who
recognizes that it possesses that quantity. Since
(Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a>) says that time is infinite, and that it is
such effectually, how can it contain number without
our taking a portion of time to measure it? From
that would result that time existed before it was
measured. But why could time not exist before the
existence of a soul to measure it? (Aristotle) might
have answered that it was begotten by the soul. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1004" id="Page_1004">1004</a></span>
mere fact that the soul measures time need not necessarily
imply that the soul produced the time; time,
along with its suitable quantity, would exist even if
nobody measured it. If however it be said that it is
the soul that makes use of extension to measure time,
we will answer that this is of no importance to determine
the notion of time.</p>

<h3>POLEMIC AGAINST EPICURUS: TIME IS NOT AN
ACCIDENT OR CONSEQUENCE OF MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p>9. (10). When (Epicurus<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a>) says that time is a
consequence of movement, he is not explaining the
nature of time; this would demand a preliminary definition
of the consequence of movement. Besides, this
alleged consequence of movement&mdash;granting the possibility
of such a consequence&mdash;must be prior, simultaneous,
or posterior. For, in whatever way we
conceive of it, it is within time. Consequently, if the
consequence of movement be time, the result would
be that time is a consequence of movement in time
(which is nonsense).</p>

<h3>PLOTINOS CAN GO NO FURTHER IN REFUTING
ENDLESS DEFINITIONS OF TIME.</h3>

<p>Now, as our purpose is to discover, not what time
is not, but what it really is, we notice that this question
has been treated at great length by many thinkers
before us; and if we were to undertake to consider
all existing opinions on the subject, we would be
obliged to write a veritable history of the subject. We
have here, however, gone to the limit of our ability
in treating it without specializing in it. As has been
seen, it is easy enough to refute the opinion that time
is the measure of the movement of the universe, and
to raise against this opinion the objections that we
have raised against the definition of time as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1005" id="Page_1005">1005</a></span>
measure of movement in general, opposing thereto the
irregularity of movement, and the other points from
which suitable arguments may be drawn. We are
therefore free to devote ourselves to an explanation of
what time really is.</p>

<h3>THE NATURE OF TIME WILL BE REVEALED BY ITS
ORIGIN.</h3>

<p>10. (11). To accomplish this we shall have to
return to the nature which, as we pointed out above,
was essential to eternity; that immutable life, wholly
realized all at once, infinite and perfect, subsisting in,
and referring to unity. Time was not yet, or at least,
it did not yet exist for the intelligible entities. Only,
it was yet to be born of <span class="locked">them,<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a></span> because (as was the
world), time, by both its reason and nature, was posterior
to the (intelligible <span class="locked">entities<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a></span>). Are we trying to
understand how time issued from among intelligible
entities while these were resting within themselves?
Here it would be useless to call upon the Muses, for
they did not yet exist. Still this might perhaps not
be useless; for (in a certain sense, that time had already
begun, then, so far as they existed within the sense-world)
they existed already. In any case, the birth
of time will be plain enough if we consider it only as
it is born and manifested. Thus much can be said
about it.</p>

<h3>TIME AROSE AS MEASUREMENT OF THE ACTIVITY
OF THE UNIVERSAL SOUL.</h3>

<p>Before priority and posteriority, time, which did not
yet exist, brooded within existence itself. But an
active nature (the universal Soul), which desired to
be mistress of herself, to possess herself, and ceaselessly
to add to the present, entered into motion, as did time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1006" id="Page_1006">1006</a></span>
along with (the Soul). We achieve a representation
of the time that is the image of eternity, by the length
that we must go through with to reach what follows,
and is posterior, towards one moment, and then towards
<span class="locked">another.<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a></span></p>

<h3>LIKE TIME, SPACE IS THE RESULT OF THE PROCESSION
OF THE UNIVERSAL SOUL.</h3>

<p>As the universal Soul contained an activity that
agitated her, and impelled her to transport into another
world what she still saw on high, she was willing to
retain all things that were present at the same time.
(Time arose not by a single fiat, but as the result of a
process. This occurred within the universal Soul, but
may well be first illustrated by the more familiar process
within) Reason, which distributes unity, not
indeed That which remains within itself, but that which
is exterior to itself. Though this process seem to be
a strengthening one, reason developing out of the seed
in which it brooded unto manifoldness, it is really a
weakening (or destructive one), inasmuch as it weakened
manifoldness by division, and weakened reason
by causing it to extend. The case was similar with
the universal Soul. When she produced the sense-world,
the latter was animated by a movement which
was only an image of intelligible movement. (While
trying to strengthen) this image-movement to the
extent of the intelligible movement, she herself (weakened),
instead of remaining exclusively eternal, became
temporal and (involuntarily) subjected what she
had produced to the conditions of time, transferring
entirely into time not only the universe, but also all its
revolutions. Indeed, as the world moves within the
universal Soul, which is its location, it also moves
within the time that this Soul bears within <span class="locked">herself.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a></span>
Manifesting her power in a varied and successive manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1007" id="Page_1007">1007</a></span>
by her mode of action, the universal Soul begat
succession. Indeed, she passes from one conception to
another, and consequently to what did not exist before,
since this conception was not effective, and since the
present life of the soul does not resemble her former
life. Her life is varied, and from the variety of her
life results the variety of <span class="locked">time.<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a></span></p>

<h3>TIME IS THE LIFE OF THE SOUL CONSIDERED IN
THE MOVEMENT BY WHICH SHE PASSES FROM
ONE ACTUALIZATION TO ANOTHER.</h3>

<p>Thus, the extension of the life of the soul produces
time, and the perpetual progression of her life produces
the perpetuity of time, and her former life constitutes
the past. We may therefore properly define time as
the life of the soul considered in the movement by
which she passes from one actualization to another.</p>

<h3>WHAT ETERNITY IS TO INTELLIGENCE, TIME IS TO
THE UNIVERSAL SOUL.</h3>

<p>We have already decided that eternity is life characterized
by rest, identity, immutability and infinity (in
intelligence). It is, further, (admitted that) this our
world is the image of the superior World (of intelligence).
We have also come to the conclusion that
time is the image of eternity. Consequently, corresponding
to the Life characteristic of Intelligence,
this world must contain another life which bears the
same name, and which belongs to that power of the
universal Soul. Instead of the movement of Intelligence,
we will have the movement characteristic of a
part of the soul (as the universal Soul ceaselessly
passes from one thought to another). Corresponding
to the permanence, identity, and immutability (of Intelligence),
we will have the mobility of a principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1008" id="Page_1008">1008</a></span>
which ceaselessly passes from one actualization to
another. Corresponding to the unity and the absence
of all extension, we will have a mere image of unity,
an image which exists only by virtue of continuity.
Corresponding to an infinity already entirely present,
we will have a progression towards infinity which perpetually
tends towards what follows. Corresponding
to what exists entirely at the same time, we will have
what exists by parts, and what will never exist entire
at the same time. The soul's existence will have to be
ceaseless acquiring of existence; if it is to reveal an
image of the complete, universal and infinite existence
of the soul; that is the reason its existence is able to
represent the intelligible existence.</p>

<h3>TIME IS AS INTERIOR TO THE SOUL AS ETERNITY
IS TO EXISTENCE.</h3>

<p>Time, therefore, is not something external to the
soul, any more than eternity is exterior to existence.
It is neither a consequence nor a result of it, any more
than eternity is a consequence of existence. It appears
within the soul, is in her and with her, as eternity is in
and with existence.</p>

<h3>TIME IS THE LENGTH OF THE LIFE OF THE
UNIVERSAL SOUL.</h3>

<p>11. (12). The result of the preceding considerations
is that time must be conceived of as the length
of the life characteristic of the universal Soul; that her
course is composed of changes that are equal, uniform,
and insensible, so that that course implies a continuity
of action. Now let us for a moment suppose that the
power of the Soul should cease to act, and to enjoy the
life she at present possesses without interruption or
limit, because this life is the activity characteristic of
an eternal Soul, an action by which the Soul does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1009" id="Page_1009">1009</a></span>
return upon herself, and does not concentrate on herself,
though enabling her to beget and produce. Now
supposing that the Soul should cease to act, that she
should apply her superior part to the intelligible world,
and to eternity, and that she should there remain calmly
united&mdash;what then would remain, unless eternity?
For what room for succession would that allow, if all
things were immovable in unity? How could she contain
priority, posteriority, or more or less duration of
time? How could the Soul apply herself to some
object other than that which occupies her? Further,
one could not then even say that she applied herself
to the subject that occupied her; she would have to
be separated therefrom in order to apply herself
thereto. Neither would the universal Sphere exist, since
it does not exist before time, because it exists and
moves within time. Besides, even if this Sphere were
at rest during the activity of the Soul, we could
measure the duration of her rest because this rest is
posterior to the rest of eternity. Since time is annihilated
so soon as the Soul ceases to act, and concentrates
in unity, time must be produced by the beginning of
the Soul's motion towards sense-objects, by the Soul's
life. Consequently (Plato<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a>) says that time is born
with the universe, because the Soul produced time with
the universe; for it is this very action of the Soul which
has produced this universe. This action constitutes
time, and the universe is within time. Plato does
indeed call the movements of the stars, time; but evidently
only figuratively, as (Plato) subsequently says
that the stars were created to indicate the divisions of
time, and to permit us to measure it easily.</p>

<h3>TIME IS NOT BEGOTTEN BY MOVEMENT, BUT ONLY
INDICATED THEREBY.</h3>

<p>Indeed, as it was not possible to determine the time
itself of the Soul, and to measure within themselves the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1010" id="Page_1010">1010</a></span>
parts of an invisible and uncognizable duration,
especially for men who did not know how to count,
the (world) Soul created day and night so that their
succession might be the basis of counting as far as two,
by the aid of this variety. <span class="locked">Plato<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a></span> indicates that as the
source of the notion of number. Later, observing the
space of time which elapses from one dawn to another,
we were able to discover an interval of time determined
by an uniform movement, so far as we direct our gaze
thereupon, and as we use it as a measure by which to
measure time. The expression "to measure time" is
premeditated, because time, considered in itself, is not
a measure. How indeed could time measure, and what
would time, while measuring, say? Would time say
of anything, "Here is an extension as large as myself?"
What indeed could be the nature of the entity that
would speak of "myself"? Would it be that according
to which quantity is measured? In this case, time
would have to be something by itself, to measure without
itself being a measure. The movement of the
universe is measured according to time, but it is not
the nature of time to be the measure of movement; it
is such only accidentally; it indicates the quantity of
movement, because it is prior to it, and differs from
it. On the other hand, in the case of a movement produced
within a determinate time, and if a number be
added thereto frequently enough, we succeed in reaching
the knowledge of how much time has elapsed. It
is therefore correct to say that the movement of the
revolution operated by the universal Sphere measures
time so far as possible, by its quantity indicating the
corresponding quantity of time, since it can neither be
grasped nor conceived otherwise. Thus what is
measured, that is, what is indicated by the revolution
of the universal Sphere, is time. It is not begotten, but
only indicated by movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1011" id="Page_1011">1011</a></span></p>

<h3>MOVEMENT IS SAID TO BE MEASURED BY SPACE,
BECAUSE OF ITS INDETERMINATION.</h3>

<p>The measure of movement, therefore, seems to be
what is measured by a definite movement, but which is
other than this movement. There is a difference, indeed,
between that which is measured, and that which
measures; but that which is measured is measured only
by accident. That would amount to saying that what
is measured by a foot-rule is an extension, without defining
what extension in itself is. In the same way,
because of the inability to define movement more
clearly because of its indeterminate nature, we say that
movement is that which is measured by space; for, by
observation of the space traversed by movement, we
can judge of the quantity of the movement.</p>

<h3>TIME IS MEASURED BY MOVEMENT, AND IN THAT
SENSE IT IS THE MEASURE OF MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p>12. (13). The revolution of the universal Sphere
leads us therefore to the recognition of time, within
which it occurs. Not only is time that in which (all
things "become," that is, grow), but time has to be
what it is even before all things, being that within
which everything moves, or rests with order and uniformity.
This is discovered and manifested to our intelligence,
but not produced by regular movement and
rest, especially by movement. Better than rest, indeed,
does movement lead us to a conception of time,
and it is either to appreciate the duration of movement
than that of rest. That is what led philosophers to
define time as the measure "of" movement, instead of
saying, what probably lay within their intention, that
time is measured "by" movement. Above all, we must
not consider that definition as adequate, adding to it
that which the measured entity is in itself, not limiting
ourselves to express what applies to it only incidentally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1012" id="Page_1012">1012</a></span>
Neither did we ever discern that such was their meaning,
and we were unable to understand their teachings
as they evidently posited the measure in the measured
entity. No doubt that which hindered us from understanding
them was that they were addressing their
teachings to learned (thinkers), or well prepared
listeners, and therefore, in their writings, they failed to
explain the nature of time considered in itself, whether
it be measure or something measured.</p>

<h3>PLATO DOES MAKE SOME STATEMENTS THAT
ALLOW OF BEING JUSTIFIED.</h3>

<p>Plato himself, indeed, does say, not that the nature
of time is to be a measure or something measured, but
that to make it known there is, in the circular movement
of the universe, a very short element (the interval
of a day), whose object is to demonstrate the smallest
portion of time, through which we are enabled to discover
the nature and quantity of time. In order to
indicate to us its nature ("being"), (Plato<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a>) says that
it was born with the heavens, and that it is the mobile
image of eternity. Time is mobile because it has no
more permanence than the life of the universal Soul,
because it passes on and flows away therewith; it is
born with the heavens, because it is one and the same
life that simultaneously produces the heavens and time.
If, granting its possibility, the life of the Soul were
reduced to the unity (of the Intelligence), there would
be an immediate cessation of time, which exists only
in this life, and the heavens, which exist only through
this life.</p>

<h3>TIME AS THE PRIOR AND POSTERIOR OF THE
MOVEMENT OF THIS LIFE WOULD BE ABSURD.</h3>

<p>The theory that time is the priority and posteriority
of this (earthly) movement, and of this inferior life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1013" id="Page_1013">1013</a></span>
is ridiculous in that it would imply on one hand that
(the priority and posteriority of this sense-life) are
something; and on the other, refusing to recognize as
something real a truer movement, which includes both
priority and posteriority. It would, indeed, amount to
attributing to an inanimate movement the privilege of
containing within itself priority with posteriority, that
is, time; while refusing it to the movement (of the
Soul), whose movement of the universal Sphere is no
more than an image. Still it is from the movement
(of the Soul) that originally emanated priority and
posteriority, because this movement is efficient by
itself. By producing all its actualizations it begets succession,
and, at the same time that it begets succession,
it produces the passing from one actualization to another.</p>

<h3>THE PRIMARY MOVEMENT OF INTELLIGENCE THE
INFORMING POWER OF TIME.</h3>

<p>(Some objector might ask) why we reduce the
movement of the universe to the movement of the
containing Soul, and admit that she is within time,
while we exclude from time the (universal) Soul's
movement, which subsists within her, and perpetually
passes from one actualization to another? The reason
is that above the activity of the Soul there exists
nothing but eternity, which shares neither her movement
nor her extension. Thus the primary movement
(of Intelligence) finds its goal in time, begets it, and
by its activity informs its duration.</p>

<h3>WHY TIME IS PRESENT EVERYWHERE; POLEMIC
AGAINST ANTIPHANES AND CRITOLAUS.</h3>

<p>How then is time present everywhere? The life
of the Soul is present in all parts of the world, as the
life of our soul is present in all parts of our body. It
may indeed be <span class="locked">objected,<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a></span> that time constitutes neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1014" id="Page_1014">1014</a></span>
a hypostatic substance, nor a real existence, being, in
respect to existence, a deception, just as we usually
say that the expressions "He was" and "He will be"
are a deception in respect to the divinity; for then He
will be and was just as is that, in which, according to
his assertion, he is going to be.</p>

<p>To answer these objections, we shall have to
follow a different method. Here it suffices to recall
what was said above, namely, that by seeing how far
a man in motion has advanced, we can ascertain the
quantity of the movement; and that, when we discern
movement by walking, we simultaneously concede that,
before the walking, movement in that man was indicated
by a definite quantity, since it caused his body
to progress by some particular quantity. As the body
was moved during a definite quantity of time, its quantity
can be expressed by some particular quantity of
movement&mdash;for this is the movement that causes it&mdash;and
to its suitable quantity of time. Then this movement
will be applied to the movement of the soul,
which, by her uniform action, produces the interval
of time.</p>

<h3>THE MOVEMENT OF THE SOUL IS ATTRIBUTED
TO THE PRIMARY MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p>To what shall the movement of the (universal)
Soul be attributed? To whatever we may choose to
attribute it. This will always be some indivisible principle,
such as primary Motion, which within its duration
contains all the others, and is contained by none
<span class="locked">other;<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a></span> for it cannot be contained by anything; it is
therefore genuinely primary. The same obtains with
the universal Soul.</p>

<h3>APPROVAL OF ARISTOTLE: TIME IS ALSO WITHIN
US.</h3>

<p>Is time also within us?<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> It is uniformly present in
the universal Soul, and in the individual souls that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1015" id="Page_1015">1015</a></span>
all united <span class="locked">together.<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a></span> Time, therefore, is not parcelled
out among the souls, any more than eternity is parcelled
out among the (Entities in the intelligible world)
which, in this respect, are all mutually uniform.</p>

this book Plotinos summated
all that Plato had to say of the
Ideas and of their dependence
on the Good, in the Timaeus,
Philebus, Phaedrus, the Republic,
the Banquet, and the Alcibiades;
correcting this summary
by the reflections of
Aristotle, in Met. xii. But
Plotinos advances beyond both
Plato and Aristotle in going
beyond Intelligence to the supreme
Good. (See Sec. 37.)
This treatise might well have
been written at the instigation
of Porphyry, who desired to
understand Plotinos's views on
this great subject.</p></div>

to divide verbs not as
transitive and intransitive, but
as verbs expressing a completed
action or state, (as to
think), and those expressing
successive action, (as, to walk).
The French language makes
this distinction by using with
these latter the auxiliary "être."
Each of these two classes are
subdivided into some verbs expressing
an absolute action, by
which the subject alone is
modified; and into other verbs
expressing relative action, referring
to, or modifying an
exterior object. These alone
are used to form the passive
voice, and Plotinos does not
want them classified apart.</p></div>

<h3 id="fnissues">Footnote Issues</h3>

<p>In these notes, "anchor" means the reference to a footnote, and "footnote" means
the information to which the anchor refers. Anchors occur within the main text,
while footnotes are grouped in sequence at the end of this eBook. The structure
of the original book required some exceptions to this, as explained below.</p>

<p>The original text used chapter endnotes. In this eBook, they have been combined into
a single, ascending sequence based on the sequence in which the footnotes (not the
anchors) occurred in the original book, and placed at the end of the eBook.</p>

<p>Three kinds of irregularities occurred in the footnotes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Some footnotes are referenced by more than one anchor, so two or more anchors
may refer to the same footnote.</li>

<li> Some anchors were out of sequence, apparently because they were added afterwards
or because they are share a footnote with another anchor. They have been renumbered
to match the numbers of the footnotes to which they refer.</li>

<li>Some footnotes have no anchors. These are noted below.</li>
</ol>
